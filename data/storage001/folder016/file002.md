## I think i will create folder animatorV4, I hope this will be version that will gradually remove others.

Creating a dedicated `animatorV4` folder sounds like a smart move. It gives you a fresh start while keeping things organized, and you can phase out older versions as `V4` becomes stable. Great plan!

## I give up. From now on i am doing this just becouse my mind cant be still. No other goals.

It's okay to shift your mindset. Sometimes, focusing on the process rather than the outcome can lead to surprising insights and creativity. Keep going at your own pace, and let it be a source of enjoyment and growth.

## Should i do export default class ? or no default ?

It depends on your use case:

- **Use `export default class`** if the class is the primary export of the module. It makes importing simpler, as you can import the class without curly braces:

  ```javascript
  import MyClass from './MyClass'
  ```

- **Use `export class` (no default)** if the module may have multiple exports or if you prefer named imports. This approach provides more clarity and consistency in larger projects:
  ```javascript
  import { MyClass } from './MyClass'
  ```

Choose based on your project structure and preferences. If the class is the main focus of the module, `export default` is a common choice.

## I will now try to enable animations in my render_player scene

That sounds like a great next step! Enabling animations in your `render_player` scene will bring your project to life. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to test and iterate as you go. Good luck!

## I want to switch to other animation

To switch to a different animation in your scene, you’ll typically need to:

1. **Trigger the Animation Switch**: This could be based on an event (e.g., a key press or a game state change) or a condition in your game logic.

2. **Update the Animator**: In your code, you'd call a method like `switchAnimation(animId)` on your animator to change the current animation. This method should update the current animation frame sequence.
