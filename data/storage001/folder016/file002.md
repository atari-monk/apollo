## I think i will create folder animatorV4, I hope this will be version that will gradually remove others.

Creating a dedicated `animatorV4` folder sounds like a smart move. It gives you a fresh start while keeping things organized, and you can phase out older versions as `V4` becomes stable. Great plan!

## I give up. From now on i am doing this just becouse my mind cant be still. No other goals.

It's okay to shift your mindset. Sometimes, focusing on the process rather than the outcome can lead to surprising insights and creativity. Keep going at your own pace, and let it be a source of enjoyment and growth.
