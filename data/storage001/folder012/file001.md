I returned from 2 weeks vacations.  
My family shack away from city.  
Like to sit on my 4x4 concrete plates spot.  
Take two light tables, chair, laptop, cables,  
keyborad, mouse, ear plugs, glasses, two sun umbrelas,  
power cable spool.  
Every day i setup this and take it back.  
Best is to sit with my back to house.  
After sun is down i sit in room by the lamp and laptop.  
Killed many moskitos, had many bites.  
Bed is bad there.  
Made phone holder and headphones stand from wood scraps.  
Miracle i found old wood glue,
my table saw, some last screws, little tools there.  
Took back old small metal vice.  
Like to take food, drink from shared kitchen and eat it alone.  
On the last day in a car there was some leafs in black plastic bags.  
I pushed my bags around these.  
I was sitting behind driver with headphones.  
In city i didnt sleep.
