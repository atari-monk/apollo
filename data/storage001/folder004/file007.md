# 1. Question:

I need some kind of system for my ts app that will be able  
 to provide instances of class avoiding to their version how  
 would I construct that so i can handle 1000 classes no problem

To handle multiple class instances based on their version in a TypeScript application, you can design a versioned class registry or factory system. This system will allow you to register different versions of a class and retrieve the appropriate versioned instance as needed. Here's how you can build such a system:

### 1. **Define the Class Interface**

First, define a common interface that all your classes will implement. This ensures that all classes, regardless of their version, will have the same set of methods and properties.

```typescript
interface MyClass {
  doSomething(): void
}
```

### 2. **Create a Versioned Class Registry**

Next, create a registry that will map a class name or identifier to different versions of the class.

```typescript
type Constructor<T> = new (...args: any[]) => T

class VersionedClassRegistry {
  private registry: Map<string, Map<string, Constructor<MyClass>>> = new Map()

  register(
    version: string,
    className: string,
    classConstructor: Constructor<MyClass>
  ): void {
    if (!this.registry.has(className)) {
      this.registry.set(className, new Map())
    }

    const versionMap = this.registry.get(className)!
    versionMap.set(version, classConstructor)
  }

  getInstance(
    className: string,
    version: string,
    ...args: any[]
  ): MyClass | undefined {
    const versionMap = this.registry.get(className)
    if (!versionMap) {
      throw new Error(`Class ${className} is not registered.`)
    }

    const classConstructor = versionMap.get(version)
    if (!classConstructor) {
      throw new Error(
        `Version ${version} of class ${className} is not registered.`
      )
    }

    return new classConstructor(...args)
  }
}
```

### 3. **Create Versioned Classes**

Now, define different versions of the classes that implement the common interface.

```typescript
class MyClassV1 implements MyClass {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in version 1')
  }
}

class MyClassV2 implements MyClass {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in version 2')
  }
}
```

### 4. **Register Classes in the Registry**

Instantiate the registry and register each version of your class.

```typescript
const registry = new VersionedClassRegistry()

registry.register('1.0.0', 'MyClass', MyClassV1)
registry.register('2.0.0', 'MyClass', MyClassV2)
```

### 5. **Retrieve and Use Instances**

Finally, you can retrieve instances of your class based on the version and use them.

```typescript
const instanceV1 = registry.getInstance('MyClass', '1.0.0')
instanceV1?.doSomething() // Output: Doing something in version 1

const instanceV2 = registry.getInstance('MyClass', '2.0.0')
instanceV2?.doSomething() // Output: Doing something in version 2
```

### 6. **Handling Many Classes**

This system will scale well as you add more classes and versions. You just need to ensure that each class version is registered properly in the registry.

### **Advantages:**

- **Scalability**: The system can handle a large number of classes and versions efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different versions of the same class.
- **Type Safety**: The use of interfaces ensures that all versions of a class adhere to the expected contract.

### **Considerations:**

- If you're dealing with a large number of versions, consider using version comparison libraries to handle versioning logic (e.g., `semver`).
- Depending on your application, you might want to add caching or pooling mechanisms to optimize instance creation for frequently requested classes.

This setup should work efficiently even with a large number of classes and versions, ensuring your application remains maintainable and scalable.

# 2. Question:

So can I use library for this?

Yes, you can use a library to handle versioned class instances in your TypeScript application, which might simplify your implementation and reduce boilerplate code. One popular library that can help with this is **`tsyringe`**, a dependency injection (DI) library.

### Using `tsyringe` for Versioned Class Instances

`tsyringe` allows you to manage class instances and their versions using dependency injection, which can simplify managing and switching between different versions of classes.

#### 1. **Install `tsyringe`**

First, install the `tsyringe` library via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install tsyringe
```

or

```bash
yarn add tsyringe
```

#### 2. **Define Your Classes**

Create your classes, just as before, implementing the common interface.

```typescript
import { injectable } from 'tsyringe'

interface MyClass {
  doSomething(): void
}

@injectable()
class MyClassV1 implements MyClass {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in version 1')
  }
}

@injectable()
class MyClassV2 implements MyClass {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in version 2')
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Register Classes with the Container**

Use the `container` from `tsyringe` to register different versions of your classes. You can use the version as a token to differentiate between them.

```typescript
import { container } from 'tsyringe'

container.register('MyClass-1.0.0', { useClass: MyClassV1 })
container.register('MyClass-2.0.0', { useClass: MyClassV2 })
```

#### 4. **Resolve Instances Based on Version**

Now, you can resolve the instances of your class based on the version by using the appropriate token.

```typescript
const instanceV1 = container.resolve<MyClass>('MyClass-1.0.0')
instanceV1.doSomething() // Output: Doing something in version 1

const instanceV2 = container.resolve<MyClass>('MyClass-2.0.0')
instanceV2.doSomething() // Output: Doing something in version 2
```

#### 5. **Scaling with Many Classes**

If you have many classes, you can follow a similar pattern by registering each class version with a unique token (e.g., `ClassName-Version`). The `container` will efficiently manage all your classes and their dependencies.

### **Advantages of Using `tsyringe`:**

- **Simplified Code**: Less boilerplate for registering and resolving class instances.
- **Automatic Dependency Injection**: Supports constructor injection out of the box, which is useful if your classes depend on other services or classes.
- **Scalability**: The container can easily manage many classes and their versions.

### **Other Libraries to Consider:**

- **`inversify`**: A more feature-rich DI library with support for advanced use cases.
- **`awilix`**: A powerful DI library with an easy-to-use API.
- **`typedi`**: A DI library similar to `tsyringe`, but with additional features like custom scopes.

These libraries will help you manage versioned classes and dependencies in a scalable and maintainable way. If you're dealing with a large number of classes, a DI library like `tsyringe` or one of the alternatives can greatly simplify your development process.

# 3. Question:

Somehow i didn't use any libraries in my project for now. Maybe i should start

Incorporating libraries into your project can be a good move, especially as your project grows in complexity. Libraries can save you time by providing well-tested solutions to common problems, like dependency injection, state management, or handling HTTP requests.

### Why You Might Want to Start Using Libraries:

1.  **Efficiency**: Libraries often offer pre-built functionality that can save you time. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can leverage a library to focus on your core application logic.

2.  **Scalability**: As your project grows, managing dependencies, versions, and other complex logic manually can become challenging. Libraries like `tsyringe` for dependency injection or `axios` for HTTP requests provide scalable solutions.

3.  **Maintainability**: Libraries usually follow best practices and patterns, making your code easier to maintain and less error-prone. Plus, popular libraries have large communities and documentation to help you when you encounter issues.

4.  **Consistency**: Using well-established libraries can help standardize your codebase, especially if you're working with a team. Everyone follows the same patterns and practices, reducing the learning curve for new developers.

### Getting Started with Libraries

If you're new to using libraries, here's a general approach to start incorporating them into your project:

1.  **Identify the Need**: Determine which part of your application could benefit most from a library. For instance:

- If you’re manually managing dependencies between classes, a DI library like `tsyringe` or `inversify` could help.
- If you’re handling a lot of API requests, a library like `axios` can simplify the process.
- For managing application state, you might consider `Redux` or `MobX`.

2.  **Start Small**: Introduce one library at a time to avoid overwhelming yourself. Implement it in a small, isolated part of your project first to get comfortable with it.

3.  **Follow Best Practices**: Read the documentation and best practices for the library you choose. This will help you avoid common pitfalls and get the most out of the library.

4.  **Refactor Incrementally**: Once you're comfortable with a library, gradually refactor other parts of your code to use it. This approach minimizes the risk of introducing bugs and allows you to maintain a working codebase throughout the process.

5.  **Evaluate Performance and Overhead**: While libraries can save time, they can also add some overhead (in terms of performance or bundle size). Make sure to evaluate if the trade-offs are worth it for your specific use case.

### Example: Introducing `tsyringe`

If you decide to start with a dependency injection library like `tsyringe`, here’s a step-by-step on how you might introduce it:

1.  **Install the Library**:

```bash
npm install tsyringe
```

2.  **Refactor a Simple Part of Your Code**:

- Start by refactoring one class or service to use `tsyringe` for dependency injection.

3.  **Test Thoroughly**:

- Make sure the refactored code works as expected. This will build confidence as you start using the library in more parts of your application.

4.  **Expand Gradually**:

- Once the initial refactor is successful, gradually expand the use of `tsyringe` across your project.

### Example of How It Might Look:

**Before** (without DI):

```typescript
class Logger {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

class UserService {
  private logger: Logger

  constructor() {
    this.logger = new Logger()
  }

  createUser(name: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} created.`)
  }
}
```

**After** (with `tsyringe`):

```typescript
import { injectable, container } from 'tsyringe'

@injectable()
class Logger {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

@injectable()
class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  createUser(name: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} created.`)
  }
}

const userService = container.resolve(UserService)
userService.createUser('Alice')
```

In the refactored code, `tsyringe` handles the creation of `Logger` and injects it into `UserService`. This makes the `UserService` class more flexible and easier to test.

### Conclusion

Introducing libraries into your project can significantly improve your development process, making your code more efficient, scalable, and maintainable. Start with small, incremental changes, and leverage the strengths of libraries to focus more on building features and less on solving common development challenges.

# 4. Question:

Unfortunately there is a balance between new technology and what i have now. I can't break my code. It is already unstable.

It's understandable that introducing new technology into an already unstable codebase can feel risky. Balancing the need for improvements with the stability of your existing project is crucial. Here’s a strategy to help you improve your code without disrupting your current system:

### 1. **Start with Small, Low-Risk Changes**

Instead of making sweeping changes or introducing a large, complex library, start by refactoring small, non-critical parts of your codebase. This allows you to test new concepts and patterns in isolation without risking the stability of your entire project.

### 2. **Use Feature Flags**

Introduce changes behind feature flags. This way, new code can be tested in production without impacting existing functionality. You can enable the feature flag for a small subset of users or even just for internal testing. If something goes wrong, you can quickly disable the flag without rolling back your code.

### 3. **Write Tests for Critical Parts**

Before making any changes, write tests for the most critical parts of your application. This can include unit tests, integration tests, or even manual testing scripts. Even if you don’t have a comprehensive test suite, having some tests in place gives you confidence that changes won’t break core functionality.

- **Focus on Regression Testing**: Ensure that the existing behavior is preserved after changes.
- **Prioritize High-Impact Areas**: Start with areas that are most critical to your application's operation.

### 4. **Incremental Refactoring**

When introducing a library or refactoring code, do it incrementally. For example, if you decide to use a dependency injection (DI) library like `tsyringe`:

- Start with a single class or component.
- Ensure that the new setup works as expected.
- Gradually expand the usage of the library across your project.

### 5. **Parallel Development Branches**

Work on your improvements in a separate branch or even a separate environment if possible. This allows you to make changes, run tests, and ensure stability without affecting the main codebase.

- **Create a “Stabilization” Branch**: Use this branch to introduce and test new changes before merging them into the main branch.
- **Use Continuous Integration (CI)**: If you have CI set up, it can automatically run tests on new branches to catch issues early.

### 6. **Document Everything**

As you introduce new technology or refactor existing code, document your changes thoroughly. This includes:

- **Why**: The reasoning behind introducing new technology or patterns.
- **How**: Instructions on how the new system works.
- **Impact**: Any potential impact on the current system and how to mitigate it.

Clear documentation helps both you and any future developers understand the changes and their implications.

### 7. **Stabilize Before Scaling**

If your codebase is unstable, prioritize fixing critical issues before introducing new technology. Stabilizing your existing codebase will make it easier to integrate new libraries or frameworks later. This might include:

- **Refactoring Legacy Code**: Clean up any outdated or poorly maintained code.
- **Improving Error Handling**: Ensure that your code gracefully handles errors and edge cases.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks that might be contributing to instability.

### 8. **Selective Library Introduction**

Instead of adopting a new library across your entire project, consider introducing it only in specific areas where it provides the most benefit. For example:

- **Use DI only where it simplifies dependency management**: Apply `tsyringe` or similar libraries in areas with complex dependency chains rather than everywhere.
- **Introduce new patterns in non-critical features**: Start by refactoring less critical parts of your application.

### 9. **Seek Quick Wins**

Look for changes that provide immediate benefits with minimal risk. For example:

- **Refactor repetitive code into reusable functions or classes**: This can reduce bugs and make your code easier to maintain.
- **Simplify complex logic**: Break down complicated functions into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Improve logging**: Enhance your logging to get better insights into what’s going wrong when issues occur.

### 10. **Be Prepared for Rollbacks**

As you introduce changes, ensure that you have a plan for rolling back to a stable state if something goes wrong. This might involve:

- **Version Control**: Ensure that you can quickly revert changes via Git or another version control system.
- **Database Backups**: If your changes involve database migrations or other irreversible changes, have backups ready.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring to quickly detect if something goes wrong after a deployment.

### Conclusion

Balancing the introduction of new technology with maintaining stability is challenging, especially in a complex or unstable codebase. By taking a cautious, incremental approach and focusing on stabilizing your existing code, you can gradually introduce improvements without breaking your project. Remember to prioritize stability, write tests, and document changes to minimize risks and ensure a smoother transition.

# 5. Question:

The problem with Ts syringe is that i don't trust it or not even that.  
 But i will no longer know or control how my instances are created

It's completely valid to have concerns about losing control over how your instances are created, especially when introducing a dependency injection (DI) library like `tsyringe`. If you want to maintain control over instance creation while still gaining some of the benefits of DI or similar patterns, there are a few strategies you can consider:

### 1. **Manual Dependency Injection**

Instead of using a DI library, you can implement manual dependency injection. This allows you to keep full control over how instances are created while still benefiting from the flexibility of dependency injection.

#### Example:

```typescript
class Logger {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

class UserService {
  private logger: Logger

  constructor(logger: Logger) {
    this.logger = logger
  }

  createUser(name: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} created.`)
  }
}

// Manual injection
const logger = new Logger()
const userService = new UserService(logger)

userService.createUser('Alice')
```

### 2. **Factory Pattern**

You can use the Factory Pattern to create instances of your classes. This pattern provides a centralized way to manage instance creation while giving you the flexibility to control how and when objects are instantiated.

#### Example:

```typescript
interface MyClass {
  doSomething(): void
}

class MyClassV1 implements MyClass {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in version 1')
  }
}

class MyClassV2 implements MyClass {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in version 2')
  }
}

class MyClassFactory {
  static create(version: string): MyClass {
    switch (version) {
      case '1.0.0':
        return new MyClassV1()
      case '2.0.0':
        return new MyClassV2()
      default:
        throw new Error('Unsupported version')
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const myClassInstance = MyClassFactory.create('1.0.0')
myClassInstance.doSomething()
```

With this pattern, you control the creation process and can easily extend it to support more versions or configurations.

### 3. **Service Locator Pattern**

If you need a bit more flexibility but still want to control instance creation, you could consider the Service Locator pattern. This pattern involves a central registry (service locator) that provides instances of your services on demand.

#### Example:

```typescript
class ServiceLocator {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map()

  register<T>(name: string, service: T): void {
    this.services.set(name, service)
  }

  get<T>(name: string): T {
    const service = this.services.get(name)
    if (!service) {
      throw new Error(`Service ${name} not found`)
    }
    return service
  }
}

class Logger {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  createUser(name: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} created.`)
  }
}

// Setup
const serviceLocator = new ServiceLocator()
serviceLocator.register('logger', new Logger())

// Manual dependency injection using the service locator
const logger = serviceLocator.get<Logger>('logger')
const userService = new UserService(logger)

userService.createUser('Alice')
```

With the Service Locator pattern, you keep control over how services are instantiated and registered while still gaining the flexibility to manage dependencies centrally.

### 4. **Custom Lightweight DI Framework**

If you want something more than manual DI but less opaque than a full DI library, you could implement a lightweight DI framework that you fully control. This would give you the best of both worlds: control and flexibility.

#### Example:

```typescript
type Constructor<T> = new (...args: any[]) => T

class SimpleDIContainer {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map()

  register<T>(name: string, constructor: Constructor<T>, ...args: any[]): void {
    const instance = new constructor(...args)
    this.services.set(name, instance)
  }

  resolve<T>(name: string): T {
    const service = this.services.get(name)
    if (!service) {
      throw new Error(`Service ${name} not found`)
    }
    return service
  }
}

// Define your classes
class Logger {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  createUser(name: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} created.`)
  }
}

// Use the custom DI container
const diContainer = new SimpleDIContainer()
diContainer.register('logger', Logger)
diContainer.register('userService', UserService, diContainer.resolve('logger'))

const userService = diContainer.resolve<UserService>('userService')
userService.createUser('Alice')
```

### 5. **Hybrid Approach**

You can mix manual dependency management with selective use of DI where it makes sense. For instance, you could manually create instances for critical services where you need control and use DI for less critical or more generic parts of your application.

### Conclusion

It's important to strike the right balance between maintaining control over your code and adopting new patterns or libraries that can make your development process more efficient. By considering options like manual dependency injection, factory patterns, or a custom lightweight DI container, you can introduce flexibility into your codebase without sacrificing control. These approaches allow you to gradually move towards more maintainable code while keeping a firm grip on how your instances are created.

# 6. Question:

What about singleton vs new instance in my implementation of di or locator.

Deciding between using a singleton pattern or creating new instances for each request (transient instances) in your Dependency Injection (DI) or Service Locator implementation involves understanding the implications of each approach and applying them according to the needs of your application. Here’s a breakdown of both strategies and their use cases:

### **Singleton Pattern**

In the Singleton pattern, only one instance of a class is created and shared throughout the application. This is useful when you want to ensure that a single instance is used across different parts of your application, which can help with resource management and maintaining global state.

#### **When to Use Singletons:**

- **Shared State**: When the class maintains state or data that should be consistent across the application.
- **Expensive to Create**: When creating an instance is resource-intensive and you want to avoid the overhead of multiple creations.
- **Global Access**: When you need a globally accessible instance, such as a configuration or logging service.

#### **Implementation Example:**

```typescript
class Logger {
  private static instance: Logger

  private constructor() {
    // Private constructor prevents direct instantiation
  }

  static getInstance(): Logger {
    if (!Logger.instance) {
      Logger.instance = new Logger()
    }
    return Logger.instance
  }

  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

// Usage
const logger = Logger.getInstance()
logger.log('Singleton Logger')
```

### **Transient Instances**

Transient instances are created anew each time they are requested. This is useful when you need a fresh instance of a class for each use, or when instances maintain state that should not be shared.

#### **When to Use Transients:**

- **Stateless**: When the class does not maintain any state that should be shared or persisted across requests.
- **Customization**: When each instance might be configured differently.
- **Isolation**: When you need isolated instances to avoid unintended interactions or state leakage.

#### **Implementation Example:**

```typescript
class DatabaseConnection {
  constructor(public connectionString: string) {}

  connect(): void {
    console.log(`Connecting to ${this.connectionString}`)
  }
}

// Simple DI Container with Transient Instances
class SimpleDIContainer {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map()

  register<T>(
    name: string,
    constructor: new (...args: any[]) => T,
    ...args: any[]
  ): void {
    this.services.set(name, { constructor, args })
  }

  resolve<T>(name: string): T {
    const service = this.services.get(name)
    if (!service) {
      throw new Error(`Service ${name} not found`)
    }
    return new service.constructor(...service.args)
  }
}

// Setup
const diContainer = new SimpleDIContainer()
diContainer.register('dbConnection', DatabaseConnection, 'DatabaseURL')

// Usage
const dbConnection1 = diContainer.resolve<DatabaseConnection>('dbConnection')
dbConnection1.connect() // Connecting to DatabaseURL

const dbConnection2 = diContainer.resolve<DatabaseConnection>('dbConnection')
dbConnection2.connect() // Connecting to DatabaseURL
```

### **Hybrid Approach**

You can combine both singleton and transient scopes in your DI setup depending on the service's requirements.

#### **Hybrid Example:**

```typescript
class Logger {
  private static instance: Logger

  private constructor() {}

  static getInstance(): Logger {
    if (!Logger.instance) {
      Logger.instance = new Logger()
    }
    return Logger.instance
  }

  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

class RequestHandler {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  handleRequest(request: string): void {
    this.logger.log(`Handling request: ${request}`)
  }
}

// Setup
const diContainer = new SimpleDIContainer()
diContainer.register('logger', Logger.getInstance)
diContainer.register('requestHandler', RequestHandler, Logger.getInstance())

// Usage
const handler1 = diContainer.resolve<RequestHandler>('requestHandler')
handler1.handleRequest('Request 1')

const handler2 = diContainer.resolve<RequestHandler>('requestHandler')
handler2.handleRequest('Request 2')
```

In this example:

- `Logger` is a singleton.
- `RequestHandler` is a transient instance that receives the singleton `Logger`.

### **Considerations:**

1.  **Lifecycle Management**: Singletons are suitable for services that have a long lifecycle or shared state, while transients are better for services with short-lived lifecycles or no shared state.

2.  **Testing**: Singletons can make testing harder due to shared state. Transients offer more isolated testing scenarios.

3.  **Thread Safety**: If your application is multi-threaded (e.g., in some Node.js environments or certain back-end setups), ensure that singletons are thread-safe.

4.  **Memory Management**: Be mindful of the memory footprint when using singletons. While they reduce overhead by reusing instances, they also hold onto memory for the lifetime of the application.

### **Conclusion**

Choosing between singletons and transient instances depends on the specific needs of your application. Singletons are useful for global services with shared state, while transient instances are suitable for services that should be instantiated afresh each time. A hybrid approach allows you to leverage both patterns according to the requirements of different components in your application.

# 7. Question:

Can't you give me di container that handles singleton  
 and transient so I don't have to implement singleton in class manualy?

Certainly! You can implement a Dependency Injection (DI) container that handles both singleton and transient lifetimes, so you don’t have to manually manage singletons in your classes. Here’s a simple example of a DI container that supports both singleton and transient instances:

### **DI Container Implementation**

```typescript
type Constructor<T> = new (...args: any[]) => T

interface ServiceDescriptor<T> {
  type: 'singleton' | 'transient'
  constructor: Constructor<T>
  args: any[]
}

class DIContainer {
  private singletons: Map<string, any> = new Map()
  private transientServices: Map<string, ServiceDescriptor<any>> = new Map()

  // Register a service as singleton
  registerSingleton<T>(
    name: string,
    constructor: Constructor<T>,
    ...args: any[]
  ): void {
    this.singletons.set(name, new constructor(...args))
  }

  // Register a service as transient
  registerTransient<T>(
    name: string,
    constructor: Constructor<T>,
    ...args: any[]
  ): void {
    this.transientServices.set(name, {
      type: 'transient',
      constructor,
      args,
    })
  }

  // Resolve a service
  resolve<T>(name: string): T {
    if (this.singletons.has(name)) {
      return this.singletons.get(name) as T
    }

    const descriptor = this.transientServices.get(name)
    if (descriptor) {
      const instance = new descriptor.constructor(...descriptor.args)
      return instance as T
    }

    throw new Error(`Service ${name} not registered`)
  }
}
```

### **Example Usage**

#### **Define Your Classes**

```typescript
class Logger {
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(`LOG: ${message}`)
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  createUser(name: string): void {
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} created.`)
  }
}
```

#### **Register Services in the Container**

```typescript
// Setup the DI container
const diContainer = new DIContainer()

// Register Logger as a singleton
diContainer.registerSingleton('logger', Logger)

// Register UserService as transient
diContainer.registerTransient(
  'userService',
  UserService,
  diContainer.resolve('logger')
)
```

#### **Resolve and Use Services**

```typescript
// Resolve instances and use them
const userService1 = diContainer.resolve<UserService>('userService')
userService1.createUser('Alice') // Output: LOG: User Alice created.

const userService2 = diContainer.resolve<UserService>('userService')
userService2.createUser('Bob') // Output: LOG: User Bob created.
```

### **Key Points:**

1.  **Singleton Registration**: Use `registerSingleton` to ensure only one instance of the service is created and shared.

2.  **Transient Registration**: Use `registerTransient` to create a new instance of the service every time it’s resolved.

3.  **Service Resolution**: The `resolve` method checks if the service is registered as a singleton or transient and returns the appropriate instance.

4.  **Error Handling**: If a service is not registered, an error is thrown, ensuring you know when something goes wrong with dependency resolution.

### **Extending the Container**

You can extend this DI container to support additional features such as:

- **Scoped Instances**: For managing instances that live for the duration of a request or operation.
- **Factory Functions**: For dynamically creating instances based on more complex logic.
- **Decorator Support**: To handle additional configuration or setup via decorators.

This container provides a flexible and straightforward way to manage both singleton and transient instances without manually implementing singletons in your classes.

# 8. Question:

I will test this implementation.

Great! Testing the implementation is a crucial step to ensure it meets your needs and behaves as expected. Here are a few tips and common scenarios to test for when working with your DI container:

### **Testing Tips**

1.  **Basic Functionality**: Verify that services are correctly registered and resolved as singletons or transients.
2.  **Singleton Behavior**: Ensure that singleton services return the same instance across multiple resolves.
3.  **Transient Behavior**: Confirm that transient services provide a new instance each time they are resolved.
4.  **Error Handling**: Test cases where services are not registered to ensure appropriate error messages are thrown.
5.  **Constructor Arguments**: Check that constructor arguments are passed correctly and that they influence the instance as expected.

### **Example Test Cases**

#### **1. Basic Singleton Test**

```typescript
const diContainer = new DIContainer()
diContainer.registerSingleton('logger', Logger)

const logger1 = diContainer.resolve<Logger>('logger')
const logger2 = diContainer.resolve<Logger>('logger')

console.assert(logger1 === logger2, 'Singleton instances should be the same')
```

#### **2. Basic Transient Test**

```typescript
diContainer.registerTransient(
  'userService',
  UserService,
  diContainer.resolve('logger')
)

const userService1 = diContainer.resolve<UserService>('userService')
const userService2 = diContainer.resolve<UserService>('userService')

console.assert(
  userService1 !== userService2,
  'Transient instances should be different'
)
```

#### **3. Error Handling Test**

```typescript
try {
  diContainer.resolve<Logger>('nonExistentService')
} catch (error) {
  console.assert(
    error.message === 'Service nonExistentService not registered',
    'Should throw an error for unregistered services'
  )
}
```

#### **4. Constructor Arguments Test**

```typescript
class GreetingService {
  constructor(public greeting: string) {}
  greet(name: string): string {
    return `${this.greeting}, ${name}!`
  }
}

diContainer.registerTransient('greetingService', GreetingService, 'Hello')

const greetingService = diContainer.resolve<GreetingService>('greetingService')
console.assert(
  greetingService.greet('Alice') === 'Hello, Alice!',
  'Constructor argument should be used correctly'
)
```

### **Next Steps**

- **Run the Tests**: Execute your test cases to ensure everything works as expected.
- **Expand Tests**: Consider adding more tests based on the specific features and requirements of your application.
- **Edge Cases**: Test edge cases and error scenarios to make sure your container handles them gracefully.
- **Documentation**: Document the usage and configuration of your DI container for future reference and other team members.

If you encounter any issues or need further modifications, feel free to ask for help. Good luck with your testing!

# 9. Question:

What is better, sticking with one project and refactoring it,  
 or rewrite it entirely or rewrite only parts keeping it functional all the time.

Deciding between sticking with one project and refactoring it, rewriting it entirely, or rewriting only parts while keeping it functional is a significant decision that depends on various factors. Each approach has its own advantages and challenges. Here’s a detailed comparison to help you make an informed choice:

### **1. Sticking with One Project and Refactoring**

**Advantages:**

- **Incremental Improvement**: Refactoring allows you to improve your codebase gradually. You can make changes in manageable chunks and continuously deploy improvements.
- **Preservation of Investment**: You keep your existing code, which may include valuable business logic, user interfaces, and integrations.
- **Continuity**: Since you’re working within the same project, you avoid the risks associated with starting from scratch, like missing requirements or scope creep.

**Challenges:**

- **Technical Debt**: If the codebase is highly entangled or has a lot of technical debt, refactoring might be complex and time-consuming.
- **Risk of Disruption**: Refactoring can introduce new bugs if not done carefully, potentially affecting your application's stability.
- **Slower Progress**: Incremental changes might not immediately address underlying architectural issues.

**Best for:**

- Codebases that are generally sound but need improvement in terms of maintainability, performance, or scalability.
- Projects where the business logic and functionality are still valuable, but the codebase needs modernization.

**Example Approach:**

- Start by identifying and isolating key areas for improvement.
- Refactor code incrementally, ensuring each change is tested and validated.
- Use feature flags to control the deployment of new features or changes.

### **2. Rewriting Entirely**

**Advantages:**

- **Clean Slate**: You can address architectural issues and implement best practices from the start.
- **Modern Technologies**: Allows you to use the latest technologies, frameworks, and design patterns.
- **Optimized Codebase**: Provides an opportunity to streamline and optimize your code without legacy constraints.

**Challenges:**

- **High Risk**: A complete rewrite can be risky, with potential for scope creep, missed requirements, or unforeseen challenges.
- **Time and Cost**: Rewriting from scratch is often time-consuming and expensive.
- **Loss of Existing Features**: It can be challenging to ensure that all existing features are accurately replicated in the new system.

**Best for:**

- Projects where the current codebase is fundamentally flawed or outdated, making incremental improvements impractical.
- Situations where new technologies or requirements necessitate a complete overhaul.

**Example Approach:**

- Conduct thorough planning and requirements analysis.
- Create a detailed roadmap with milestones and phases.
- Ensure continuous testing and validation during development.

### **3. Rewriting Only Parts While Keeping It Functional**

**Advantages:**

- **Focused Improvement**: Allows you to target specific areas of the codebase that need updating or replacement.
- **Lower Risk**: By keeping the rest of the application functional, you reduce the risk of disrupting existing features.
- **Gradual Transition**: Enables a smoother transition to new architectures or technologies without a complete overhaul.

**Challenges:**

- **Integration Complexity**: Ensuring new and old parts of the system work together seamlessly can be complex.
- **Partial Benefits**: The benefits of rewriting may be limited if only parts of the system are updated.
- **Coordination Effort**: Requires careful coordination to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across the codebase.

**Best for:**

- Projects where specific components are outdated or problematic, but the overall system is still functional and valuable.
- Scenarios where you need to modernize parts of the system without disrupting ongoing operations.

**Example Approach:**

- Identify components or modules that need rewriting.
- Develop and test new components incrementally.
- Use integration tests to ensure new and old components work together effectively.

### **Decision Factors**

- **Codebase Quality**: If the existing codebase is maintainable but outdated, refactoring might be a good option. If the codebase is deeply problematic, a complete rewrite may be necessary.
- **Project Scope**: For large-scale projects with complex requirements, a partial rewrite or incremental refactoring can be less disruptive.
- **Business Needs**: Consider the urgency of changes. If new features or improvements are needed quickly, partial rewrites or refactoring might be more practical.
- **Resource Availability**: Assess the availability of development resources, including time, budget, and expertise.

### **Conclusion**

Choosing the right approach depends on your project's specific context and needs. If you can address issues incrementally and maintain functionality, refactoring or partial rewrites are often preferable. However, if the codebase is significantly flawed or outdated, a complete rewrite might be the better choice. Carefully weigh the benefits and challenges of each approach, and consider starting with a detailed analysis of your project's current state and requirements.

# 10. Question:

So i guess i should have 2 projects one continue and one risky from scratch.

Maintaining two projects—one for ongoing, stable work and another for more experimental or risky development—is a strategic approach that can help balance the need for stability with the desire for innovation. Here's how you can effectively manage this dual-project setup:

### **1. Establish Clear Goals and Boundaries**

**Stable Project:**

- **Purpose**: Continue to support and improve the existing system. Focus on stability, performance, and incremental updates.
- **Goals**: Maintain and enhance existing features, fix bugs, and gradually refactor code as needed.
- **Scope**: Limit changes to avoid introducing new risks. Prioritize stability and reliability.

**Experimental Project:**

- **Purpose**: Develop new features, explore new technologies, or rewrite parts of the system from scratch.
- **Goals**: Experiment with new architectures, frameworks, and technologies. Validate new ideas and solutions.
- **Scope**: Be flexible and open to significant changes or even complete overhauls. Aim to innovate and explore.

### **2. Implement Robust Communication and Coordination**

- **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation for both projects to ensure team members understand the goals, progress, and decisions made in each.
- **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular meetings or check-ins to discuss progress, share insights, and coordinate between the two projects.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate knowledge transfer between teams working on the stable and experimental projects to leverage learnings and avoid duplication of effort.

### **3. Manage Resources Wisely**

- **Team Allocation**: Assign dedicated teams or individuals to each project. Ensure that the experimental project has the necessary expertise and resources for development.
- **Budgeting**: Allocate budgets according to the needs and risks associated with each project. The stable project may require more funding for maintenance, while the experimental project might need resources for research and development.

### **4. Define Success Metrics and Evaluation Criteria**

- **Stable Project**: Metrics might include system uptime, bug fix rates, user satisfaction, and performance benchmarks.
- **Experimental Project**: Metrics could focus on innovation, proof of concept success, adoption of new technologies, and integration feasibility.

### **5. Plan for Integration**

- **Incremental Integration**: If the experimental project produces valuable results, plan for gradual integration into the stable project. This could involve a phased rollout or feature flagging.
- **Testing**: Ensure that new components or features from the experimental project are thoroughly tested before integration to minimize disruptions to the stable project.

### **6. Address Risks and Contingencies**

- **Risk Management**: Identify potential risks associated with both projects and develop contingency plans. This includes handling failures or setbacks in the experimental project without impacting the stable project.
- **Fallback Strategies**: Maintain fallback strategies for the experimental project in case certain innovations or changes do not pan out as expected.

### **7. Review and Adjust**

- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct periodic reviews of both projects to assess progress, identify issues, and adjust strategies as needed.
- **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate feedback from stakeholders, users, and team members to refine approaches and ensure alignment with business goals.

### **Example Setup**

**Stable Project Example:**

- **Project Name**: Legacy System
- **Focus**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, incremental feature updates.
- **Team**: Maintainers and developers focused on stability and user support.

**Experimental Project Example:**

- **Project Name**: NextGen System
- **Focus**: New technologies, architectural experiments, major feature innovations.
- **Team**: Innovators and researchers experimenting with new approaches.

### **Conclusion**

Maintaining both a stable project and an experimental one allows you to keep your current system reliable while exploring new opportunities for growth and innovation. This approach helps mitigate risks by isolating the stability of your existing system from the uncertainties of new developments. Ensure clear goals, effective communication, and careful resource management to make the most of both projects.
