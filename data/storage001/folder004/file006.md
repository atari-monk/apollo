# Policy

1. You should not sit to code, unless u have time and energy to do something that feels done.

2. This project has no libraries. Only ts. In engine library.

3. Max 3 level nesting for folders, prefer 2 if possible.

   - That means, for 'root/packages/engine/src', from src maximally 3 folders, src/level1/level2/level3.
   - It should definitely contribute to better quality and easier maintenance.

4. Classes versions are named in convention className, classNameV2, ....  
   Versions Should be documented.

5. It's nice to first open files related to those on witch job is done,  
   pin them, and open changed files.  
   This way work is done on files open normally and files that needs  
   to be updated related to that, are pinned and ready to modiffy.

6. Before each commit, check diffs view.
