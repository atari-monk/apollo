# Policy

1. Max 3 level nesting for folders, prefer 2 if possible.

   - That means, for 'root/packages/engine/src', from src maximally 3 folders, src/level1/level2/level3.
   - It should definitely contribute to better quality and easier maintenance.

2. Classes versions are named in convention classNameV1, classNameV2, ....  
   Versions Should be documented.
