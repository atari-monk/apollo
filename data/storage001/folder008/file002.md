## Pier Foundation

### Frost issue

In Kraków, Poland, the frost line (the depth to which the ground can freeze in winter) typically ranges between 0.8 meters (80 cm) and 1.2 meters (120 cm). The depth can vary depending on the specific microclimate and the severity of the winter.

If you're placing the foundation at a height of 120 cm, this generally aligns with the maximum frost line depth in the Kraków area. This should make the foundation frost-resistant under typical conditions. However, to ensure full frost resistance, it is advisable to have the base of your foundation slightly below the maximum frost line, around 1.2 meters or deeper.

Given that your planned cylinder foundation is 120 cm tall, this depth should be sufficient. However, if you want additional security, consider slightly increasing the depth of the foundation, particularly if you expect an exceptionally cold winter or want to accommodate slight variations in local conditions.

### Layout

Yes, you're correct. Given the dimensions of 875 cm x 400 cm and your plan to space the foundations 150 cm apart along the longer side (875 cm) and have three rows spaced evenly along the shorter side (400 cm), the correct placement should be as follows:

### **Configuration:**

- **Base Dimensions**: 875 cm x 400 cm
- **Foundation Spacing**:
  - **Along the 875 cm side**: 150 cm apart
  - **Across the 400 cm side**: 0 cm, 200 cm, and 400 cm (three rows)

### **Cylinder Positions:**

1. **Along the 400 cm width**:

   - Place rows at 0 cm, 200 cm, and 400 cm.
   - This divides the 400 cm side into three equal sections.

2. **Along the 875 cm length**:
   - Place cylinders at 0 cm, 150 cm, 300 cm, 450 cm, 600 cm, 750 cm, and 875 cm in each row.

### **Summary:**

- **Rows**: 3 rows across the 400 cm side at 0 cm, 200 cm, and 400 cm.
- **Cylinders in Each Row**: 7 cylinders, spaced 150 cm apart along the 875 cm length.
- **Total Cylinders**: 21 cylinders.

This layout ensures that your foundation is evenly distributed across the entire base, providing solid support for the structure and accounting for frost resistance.

## Pier Height

### **Foundation Height:**

- **Below Ground (Frost Line Protection)**:
  - **130 cm below ground** ensures that the foundation extends well below the frost line, providing stability and preventing frost heave.
- **Above Ground (Protection & Ventilation)**:
  - **30 cm above ground** offers adequate clearance from moisture, debris, and minor flooding, and allows for proper ventilation under the structure.

### **Total Foundation Height**:

- **Overall Height**:
  - **160 cm** total (130 cm below ground + 30 cm above ground).

### **Benefits**:

- **Frost Protection**: By extending 130 cm below ground, your foundation is safely below the frost line, which can reach up to 120 cm in the Kraków region.
- **Environmental Protection**: The 30 cm above ground provides sufficient clearance to protect the structure from surface moisture, snow accumulation, and potential flooding.

This setup should provide a robust, frost-resistant foundation that meets the local conditions and structural requirements.

If you want to account for the gravel layer and maintain a good height above the ground, aiming for a total foundation height of 170 cm is a solid approach. Here's how it breaks down:

### **Foundation Setup:**

- **Below Ground**: 130 cm (to be below the frost line).
- **Above Ground**: 40 cm (to account for the gravel layer and maintain effective clearance).

### **With Gravel:**

- **Gravel Layer**: 10 cm.
- **Effective Height Above Gravel**: 40 cm - 10 cm = 30 cm.

### **Summary:**

- **Total Foundation Height**: 170 cm (130 cm below ground + 40 cm above ground).
- **Height Above Gravel**: 30 cm.

### **Benefits:**

1. **Adequate Clearance**: With 30 cm above the gravel, you will have a good buffer to keep the structure safe from surface moisture and other environmental factors.
2. **Drainage and Protection**: The 10 cm gravel layer helps with drainage, and the increased height above ground ensures that any water, snow, or debris doesn’t impact the foundation.

This setup provides robust protection against frost and moisture, while also accommodating the gravel layer for improved drainage.
