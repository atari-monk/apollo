## Flattening file system

I have flattened mostly to one folder.  
Rarly there is second level nesting.  
Maximally there is third level folder nesting.  
I prefer first level folder with no subfolders.  
This removed what was like nearlly 'intentional obfiuscation'.  
Like hidding in folders to not see what are problems.  
I think this simple policy should improve quality, comfort of coding and more.
