## I need image link in md.

Certainly! Hereâ€™s how you can format an image link in Markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

Replace `Alt text` with a description of the image, and `https://example.com/image.jpg` with the actual URL of the image you want to link to.

For example:

```markdown
![Beautiful Landscape](https://example.com/landscape.jpg)
```

This will display an image with the description "Beautiful Landscape."
