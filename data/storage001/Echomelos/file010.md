# Pls privide me with commands to generate nx project an in it api with nestjs, i want to have this automated.

To automate the creation of an Nx workspace with a NestJS API, you can use the following commands in your terminal. These commands will set up an Nx workspace, generate a NestJS application within it, and add the necessary dependencies.

1. **Install Nx globally** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   npm install -g nx
   ```

2. **Create a new Nx workspace**:

   ```bash
   npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace
   ```

   Replace `my-workspace` with your desired workspace name. During the setup, you'll be prompted to choose a preset. Select the "Empty" preset, as it gives you a blank slate to work with.

3. **Change directory to your new workspace**:

   ```bash
   cd my-workspace
   ```

4. **Generate a NestJS application**:

   ```bash
   nx generate @nx/nest:application my-api
   ```

   Replace `my-api` with your desired application name.

5. **Serve the application**:

   ```bash
   nx serve my-api
   ```

   This command will start your NestJS API in development mode.

6. **Optional: Generate a new module, service, or controller**:
   - **Generate a module**:
     ```bash
     nx generate @nx/nest:module my-module --project=my-api
     ```
   - **Generate a service**:
     ```bash
     nx generate @nx/nest:service my-service --project=my-api
     ```
   - **Generate a controller**:
     ```bash
     nx generate @nx/nest:controller my-controller --project=my-api
     ```

These commands will create a new Nx workspace with a NestJS application and allow you to start building your API quickly.

# So this is alrady api that can be tested ?

Yes, after following the steps I provided, the generated NestJS application within your Nx workspace is a basic API that can be tested right away.

Hereâ€™s what you get out of the box:

1. **Basic NestJS Application**: The generated NestJS application (`my-api` in the example) includes a simple module (`AppModule`), a controller (`AppController`), and a service (`AppService`).

2. **Default Route**: The controller (`AppController`) will typically have a basic route set up, usually at the root (`/`). This route returns a simple message like `"Welcome to my-api!"` or `"Hello World!"`.

3. **Running the API**: When you run the command `nx serve my-api`, the NestJS application starts a development server, usually on port `3333` (or another available port).

4. **Testing the API**:
   - Open your browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3333/` (or the port specified in your terminal after running `nx serve`).
   - You should see a response from the API.

### Example Testing with `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3333/
```

This command should return a response, for example:

```bash
{"message":"Welcome to my-api!"}
```

### Example Testing with a Browser:

Just navigate to `http://localhost:3333/` in your web browser, and you should see the message displayed.

### Customizing the API:

- You can add more routes by creating additional controllers or by extending the existing `AppController`.
- Services can be used to handle business logic and can be injected into controllers.

This basic setup provides a starting point for building a more complex API.
