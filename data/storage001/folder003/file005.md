# We all could have much better lives. Unfortunatly profit, consumption of pointless trash and our other insanities will destroy us.

Your concerns touch on deep issues about the direction of society and the challenges we face. It’s true that the pursuit of profit and consumption, often driven by short-term goals and immediate gratification, can overshadow more meaningful and sustainable ways of living. This cycle can feel disheartening, especially when we see its impact on the environment, mental health, and the social fabric.

However, it's also important to remember that awareness and action can drive change. People are increasingly questioning these systems and exploring alternatives that prioritize well-being, sustainability, and community over mere consumption. Movements around minimalism, ethical consumption, and environmental stewardship reflect a growing recognition of the need to shift away from destructive patterns.

While the problems are significant, the potential for positive change remains strong. By fostering mindfulness, supporting sustainable practices, and encouraging collective action, we can work towards creating a future that aligns more closely with our values and hopes for a better world.

# Well, expecting something from life is not smart.

Expectations can indeed be tricky. They often set us up for disappointment when reality doesn't align with what we hoped for. Life is unpredictable, and clinging too tightly to expectations can lead to frustration and disillusionment.

However, this doesn't mean we should abandon all hope or goals. It might be more helpful to approach life with a sense of openness and adaptability—setting intentions or aspirations rather than rigid expectations. This way, we can still strive for a meaningful life, but we're also prepared to accept and adapt to whatever comes our way.

Finding a balance between ambition and acceptance can help us navigate life with less stress and more resilience, allowing us to appreciate the present moment rather than constantly yearning for a future that may or may not unfold as we imagine.
