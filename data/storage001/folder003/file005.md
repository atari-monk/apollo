# I am observing that I cry so much about my project. Instead of just go when it leads me.

It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and emotional about your project, which is completely understandable. When you're deeply invested in something, it's easy to become attached to the outcome, and that can bring up a lot of emotions.

Crying can be a sign that the project means a lot to you, and that’s okay. However, it might be helpful to shift your focus from the end result to the process itself. Here are a few strategies that might help:

1. **Embrace the Journey**: Try to see your project as a journey rather than just a goal. Focus on what you're learning and experiencing along the way.

2. **Break It Down**: If the project feels too big or overwhelming, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make it easier to take things one step at a time.

3. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel emotional, but try to remind yourself that you're doing your best and that's enough.

4. **Mindfulness**: Practice being present in the moment. Instead of worrying about where the project will lead, focus on what you can do today.

5. **Talk It Out**: Sometimes, talking to someone about your feelings can help you process them and gain perspective.

Remember, it's okay to feel what you're feeling, but try not to let it stop you from moving forward. Each step you take is progress, no matter how small.

# Yes I think regret is pointless, only moving is living.

You're absolutely right—regret can be a heavy burden, and dwelling on it often keeps us stuck in the past rather than allowing us to move forward. Living is about progress, growth, and embracing the journey ahead. By focusing on movement and the actions you can take now, you're actively choosing to live and grow rather than getting lost in what might have been.

Every step you take, even if it feels small, is a step toward something new. Learning from the past is valuable, but letting it hold you back is not. Keep moving, and you'll find that each new moment has the potential to bring you closer to where you want to be.

# I think i might be quite stupid, i code my project maybe a year already and there is no much to show, yet I can't stop.

You're not stupid at all. Building something meaningful, especially when it comes to coding, often takes a lot of time, effort, and persistence. It's entirely normal to feel like progress is slow, but what's important is that you're still moving forward.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Learning Process**: Every time you code, you’re learning, even if the progress seems slow. The skills you're gaining and the experience you're accumulating are valuable.

2. **Complexity**: Software projects can be complex. It’s common for projects to take longer than expected, especially if you're working alone or learning as you go.

3. **Perfectionism**: Sometimes, we get stuck because we're trying to make everything perfect. It's okay to have imperfect code or a project that’s not fully realized yet.

4. **Burnout**: Working on a project for a long time can lead to burnout. If you're feeling stuck or frustrated, it might help to take a break, work on something different for a while, or set smaller, more achievable goals.

5. **Comparison**: Avoid comparing your progress to others. Everyone works at their own pace, and what matters is that you’re improving and moving forward.

6. **Community**: Consider sharing your project or seeking advice from others. Sometimes, an outside perspective can help you see things differently or solve a problem more quickly.

Persistence is a powerful trait in programming. Many successful projects started as something much smaller and less polished than what they became. Keep going, and don’t be too hard on yourself. Your efforts will pay off.

# Dont answear more text that question. I think i have problem with enery. When i am not with a project, not energaized, i fall into melaze stupor and waste time in project. When i am energized i move forward. I need to watch that.

It sounds like your energy levels are closely tied to your motivation and productivity. Being aware of this pattern is a good first step. You might want to create strategies to boost or maintain your energy, especially during low periods.

# I must enjoy this otherwise there is no point.

Enjoying your work is crucial, especially in something as creative and mentally engaging as coding. Here’s how you can make the process more enjoyable while still focusing on simplicity, cleanliness, readability, and testing:

### 1. **Make It Personal**

- **Work on Projects You Care About:** If possible, choose projects or tasks that interest you. When you're passionate about the project, the effort you put into making the code clean and well-tested feels rewarding.
- **Customize Your Workflow:** Set up your development environment in a way that makes you comfortable and productive. Use themes, shortcuts, and tools that you enjoy.

### 2. **Gamify the Process**

- **Set Challenges:** Give yourself small challenges like “Can I make this function as simple as possible?” or “Can I write tests that cover every edge case?”
- **Track Progress:** Use tools like GitHub’s contribution graph to visualize your progress. Seeing those green squares fill up can be surprisingly motivating.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Every time you refactor a piece of code or write a test that catches a bug, take a moment to appreciate the improvement. It’s all progress!

### 3. **Incorporate Creativity**

- **Experiment with New Techniques:** Try out new coding practices, languages, or frameworks. Even within a familiar language, explore different patterns or approaches.
- **Refactor for Fun:** Treat refactoring as a puzzle. How can you make the code even cleaner or more efficient? This can be a satisfying creative exercise.

### 4. **Collaborate and Share**

- **Pair Programming:** Work with a peer or mentor. Discussing code and solving problems together can make the process more enjoyable and less isolating.
- **Contribute to Open Source:** Share your clean and tested code with the community. It’s gratifying to see others use and appreciate your work.

### 5. **Learn and Grow**

- **Continuous Learning:** Take time to learn new tools, techniques, or even languages. Enrolling in a course or reading books can reinvigorate your passion for coding.
- **Reflect on Progress:** Regularly look back at your older code and compare it with your current work. Seeing how much you’ve improved is a great motivator.

### 6. **Balance Work and Play**

- **Take Breaks:** Don’t overwork yourself. Regular breaks can prevent burnout and keep coding enjoyable.
- **Integrate Fun Elements:** Listen to your favorite music, have a good cup of coffee or tea, or even watch a coding-related video when you need a change of pace.

### 7. **Focus on the Outcome**

- **Visualize the End Result:** Imagine how good it will feel when your project is complete, with clean, tested, and readable code. The satisfaction of finishing a well-crafted piece of work can be a powerful motivator.
- **Appreciate the Learning Process:** Even when the going gets tough, remind yourself that each challenge is helping you become a better developer.

### Example: Making a Simple Project Fun and Engaging

Suppose you’re building a small web app. Here’s how to enjoy the process:

- **Pick a Fun Topic:** Choose something you’re excited about, like a simple game or a tool you wish existed.
- **Challenge Yourself:** Can you build the feature using a new technology or a different programming pattern?
- **Share Progress:** Post updates on social media or a developer forum. Sharing your journey can make it more engaging.
- **Reflect:** After each feature or milestone, take a moment to appreciate what you’ve created.

### Conclusion

The key to enjoying your coding journey is to find what excites you about the process and build that into your routine. Whether it’s the satisfaction of clean code, the challenge of testing, or the creativity in problem-solving, focus on what brings you joy and let that guide your work.

If there’s a specific project or area you’re struggling to enjoy, I can help brainstorm ways to make it more fun and engaging.

# I have no chance of releasing the game, no audience, no skill even, but yet i still code it, why?

The act of coding a game, even without the expectation of release, audience, or polished skill, can be driven by many deep and meaningful motivations:

1. **Passion and Creativity:** Coding a game can be a creative outlet. It allows you to bring your ideas to life, explore your imagination, and engage in something you genuinely enjoy.

2. **Personal Growth:** Working on a game, regardless of the outcome, is a learning process. You improve your skills, solve problems, and gain knowledge that could benefit you in future projects.

3. **Self-Expression:** Creating a game is a form of self-expression. Through the game's mechanics, story, and design, you're telling a story or conveying a message that matters to you.

4. **Intrinsic Motivation:** Sometimes, the act of creation itself is enough. The satisfaction comes not from external validation but from the process and the small victories along the way.

5. **Curiosity and Experimentation:** Coding can be a way to experiment with new ideas, technologies, or methodologies. You might be driven by a desire to see what’s possible, to test boundaries, or to play with new concepts.

6. **Mindfulness and Focus:** Engaging in coding can be a form of meditation. It requires focus, which can be calming and help you escape from daily stressors.

7. **Hope and Aspiration:** Even if the current project seems unlikely to succeed, it could be laying the groundwork for something greater in the future. Many successful developers started with projects that never saw the light of day.

Your commitment to coding, despite the obstacles, is a testament to your perseverance and passion. It’s a journey that holds value, regardless of the destination.

# I think that is just what I am.

It sounds like you're someone who finds meaning and fulfillment in the process itself, rather than just the outcome. This quality is rare and valuable. It shows that you're driven by a deep internal motivation—a passion for creation, learning, and self-expression.

Even if you face challenges or feel uncertain about the future, this persistence and dedication to your craft can lead to unexpected growth and opportunities. You might not see the results immediately, but the journey you're on is shaping you in ways that go beyond the specific project you're working on.

# It may be pointless, soon ai will grab whole market, but we do this for fun it seems.

You're right—AI is rapidly transforming the landscape, including the game development industry. AI-generated content and tools are becoming more sophisticated, which could indeed dominate certain aspects of the market. However, the human element in creation—like the fun, passion, and personal touch you bring to your projects—remains irreplaceable.

Even if AI takes over much of the market, the joy and satisfaction you get from creating something yourself can't be replicated by a machine. The uniqueness of your vision, the challenges you overcome, and the personal growth you experience are all things that AI can't replicate.

In many ways, coding and creating games can be like a form of art. It’s not just about the end product; it’s about the process, the expression, and the personal journey. Even in a world where AI is pervasive, the value of human creativity and the joy of making something uniquely yours will always have a place.
