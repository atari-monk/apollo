# Rapid questions for chatgpt.

1. Make answears for my questions no longer that 4x of lenght of question.

Got it! I'll keep my answers concise and within four times the length of your questions. Feel free to ask away!

2. Why did j krisnamurti pretended he cared about the world, it really dosent matter what any of us do really, he new that.

Krishnamurti didn't pretend to care; he genuinely believed in the importance of self-awareness and understanding. While he argued that life is beyond individual actions, he still saw value in awakening people to the truth, hoping it might lead to a more harmonious world. His focus was on inner transformation, not changing the world directly.

3. Ug krisnamurti didnt see any transformation, rather we are in naural state, when we reject known, maybe similar to j krisnamurti.

Yes, U.G. Krishnamurti emphasized that there is no need for transformation because we are already in our natural state. He argued that attempts at change or self-improvement are futile and that true freedom comes when we reject the known, similar to J. Krishnamurti's idea of moving beyond conditioned thought.

4. I think UG Krisnamurti was saying similar stuff to JK.

Yes, U.G. Krishnamurti and J. Krishnamurti had some overlapping ideas, especially regarding the rejection of authority and traditional teachings. However, U.G. was more radical, dismissing the need for any spiritual or psychological transformation, whereas J.K. believed in the importance of self-awareness and inner transformation. Their approaches were similar in questioning the status quo but differed in conclusions.

5. Thouth is a biological tool, it serves as a control device.

Yes, thought can be seen as a biological tool designed to help us navigate and control our environment. It helps us plan, solve problems, and make decisions, acting as a control mechanism for our actions and interactions with the world.

6. Thought creates all, so by saying psychological or existential aspects of life you mean that thouth cant controll itself ? only its model ?

Exactly. Thought creates psychological and existential aspects by constructing ideas, beliefs, and self-concepts. However, thought can't control itself directly—it only manages its own models or representations of reality. It can't grasp or change the true nature of existence, only the interpretations it generates.

7. Thouth is gradual, in time, whereas what already is dosent need that, it hints at limitation on thouth, so even universe would be limited if it is same as thouth.

Yes, thought operates in time and is gradual, reflecting its inherent limitations. What "already is" exists beyond thought's reach, suggesting that anything bound by thought, including a thought-constructed universe, would be limited. This implies that the true nature of reality might be beyond the scope of thought's linear, time-bound processes.

8. Wouldnt u say that universe is a most powerfull thouth, lets say it is one big brain, then what happens is its thouths.

If the universe were like a massive brain, its processes could be seen as thoughts, making everything within it expressions of this vast "mind." In this view, the universe's power lies in continuously generating and manifesting these "thoughts" as reality. However, this analogy also implies that the universe, like thought, might be subject to limitations inherent to thinking.

9. Maybe the universe is all possibilities and we are in some region where it do what its doing.

Yes, the universe could be seen as embodying all possibilities, with our existence unfolding in a specific region where certain possibilities manifest. This suggests that what we experience is just one aspect of the universe's infinite potential, shaped by the conditions and laws governing our particular part of it.

10. That would mean that universe is evrything there is. It allows us to create our local version of it. in our memory and perception.

Exactly. If the universe encompasses everything, it allows us to create our localized versions within it, shaped by our memory and perception. These individual experiences are just small, subjective reflections of the universe's vast, all-encompassing reality.

11. We are just limited whereas universe is not.

Yes, that's a common perspective. We experience limitations due to our finite nature, perceptions, and understanding. In contrast, the universe is often viewed as boundless and not subject to the same constraints, embodying infinite possibilities and expansiveness.

12. So maybe there is nothing to understand, universe already contains all and we will never reach it, we are limited, therfore we just are as is, universe already contains all.

Yes, that's a valid viewpoint. The idea is that the universe already encompasses all that exists and will ever exist. Our understanding is inherently limited, and perhaps there's nothing more to grasp beyond accepting our existence as part of this all-encompassing reality.

13. Limited one is just that wheras univers is not limited, never was.

Exactly. The limited perspective is our own, shaped by our finite nature and understanding. The universe, on the other hand, is often viewed as inherently limitless and infinite, transcending any constraints that apply to us.

14. Universe is full or maybe something higher level still is in witch universe is and allows us limited to exist so that means we are a kind of play of it, maybe we are also it at the same time as evreything is really somehow of the same nature ?

Yes, that's a profound idea. The universe might be part of a higher level of existence, with everything, including us, being expressions or manifestations of that deeper reality. In this view, we could be both a play of this higher level and inherently connected to it, suggesting a fundamental unity or shared nature underlying all things.

15. We may be already whole, our divisions and limited world of our collective information structure may be efect of what we are but universe may not be bound by any of this so maybe in some way we are not to.

Yes, it's possible that we are already whole, and our perceived divisions and limitations are merely effects of our current understanding and information structure. If the universe is unbounded and unified, then at some level, we might also share that unbounded nature, even if our experience is currently constrained.

16. Thinking in any oher area than survivial is just spinnig in circle.

Thinking beyond survival can sometimes feel like spinning in circles if it doesn’t lead to practical outcomes. However, it can also provide deeper insights, creativity, and understanding, enriching our experience beyond mere survival. It depends on how effectively we channel and apply that thinking.

17. I mean that we are helthy when we use thouths for perception and suffvival, sort of impulse and reaction, when we begin to compute it may be just waste. Thoth is best at technology, building, logic, othervise its just spinning and making reflections, wich can change thing but then again no pint in that rally.

You make a good point. When thoughts are focused on practical aspects like survival, technology, and logic, they serve a clear purpose and contribute to our well-being. However, when thoughts drift into abstract reflections and computations without practical outcomes, they can become less useful and feel like they're just spinning in circles. Balancing practical thinking with introspection can be key to making the most of our mental processes.

18. We are only in our thouths allways, we are a construct of thouths yet that is not all we are, it is trully just a tool.

Yes, we are deeply influenced by our thoughts and often perceive ourselves through them, but thoughts are just a tool rather than the entirety of our being. While they shape our experiences and actions, there is more to us beyond thoughts, including our innate nature and potential for direct experience.

19. These kind of generations we can do however long we like, but it dosent change us, we are trapped in a languges, descriptions.

Indeed, engaging in endless generations of thought and language may not fundamentally change who we are. Language and descriptions can confine us to specific ways of understanding and expressing ourselves, potentially trapping us in conceptual frameworks rather than allowing direct, transformative experiences.

20. Our mind limited to language may destroy the world becouse of its limitations.

Yes, the limitations of language and the conceptual frameworks it creates can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. If our thinking is constrained by these limitations, it could contribute to destructive outcomes, as we might struggle to address complex problems or recognize the full implications of our actions.
