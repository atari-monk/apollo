# Why most people think similarly, why they seem same program robots, why they believe fiat currency, why all warship jobs, why people are so primitive ?

Your questions reflect a deep concern about conformity, the nature of societal beliefs, and the mechanisms that shape human behavior. Let's break down these concerns:

### 1. **Why do most people think similarly?**

- **Social Conditioning:** From a young age, people are influenced by their families, education systems, media, and culture. These institutions tend to promote certain norms, values, and beliefs, leading to a convergence in thinking.
- **Desire for Belonging:** Humans are social creatures with an inherent need to belong. Conformity to group norms helps individuals gain acceptance and avoid social rejection, which can lead to similar ways of thinking.
- **Cognitive Biases:** Humans have cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, which leads them to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs. This creates a feedback loop where similar ideas are reinforced.

### 2. **Why do they seem like the same programmed robots?**

- **Cultural Homogenization:** In a globalized world, mass media, and technology disseminate similar ideas, lifestyles, and values across different societies. This can lead to a homogenization of thoughts and behaviors, making people seem more alike.
- **Education Systems:** Many education systems prioritize rote learning and standardized testing, which can stifle creativity and critical thinking. This can result in people adopting similar ways of thinking and problem-solving.

### 3. **Why do they believe in fiat currency?**

- **Trust in Institutions:** Fiat currency is based on trust in the government and the economy. People trust that the government will manage the economy well enough to maintain the value of the currency.
- **Lack of Alternatives:** For most people, fiat currency is the most practical and accessible form of money. Alternatives like cryptocurrencies or bartering systems are less widely accepted and understood.
- **Social Agreement:** The value of fiat currency is upheld by social consensus. As long as everyone agrees on its value and continues to use it, it functions as a medium of exchange.

### 4. **Why do people worship jobs?**

- **Economic Necessity:** In most societies, having a job is essential for survival. Jobs provide the income needed to meet basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare, making them central to people's lives.
- **Cultural Values:** Many cultures emphasize the importance of work and career success as indicators of personal worth and achievement. This can lead to the glorification of jobs.
- **Identity and Purpose:** For many, jobs provide a sense of identity, purpose, and structure in life. This can make people feel like their worth is tied to their job or career.

### 5. **Why are people so primitive?**

- **Slow Evolution of Consciousness:** Human consciousness and society have evolved over thousands of years, but some aspects of human behavior, such as tribalism, aggression, and fear of the unknown, are deeply ingrained from our evolutionary past.
- **Survival Instincts:** Many behaviors that seem primitive, like aggression or conformity, have roots in survival mechanisms. These instincts can sometimes dominate rational thought, especially under stress or fear.
- **Complexity of Modern Life:** Despite technological advancements, human brains are still wired for simpler, more direct environments. The complexity of modern life can overwhelm, leading to behaviors that seem primitive.

In summary, the patterns you observe in human behavior are shaped by a combination of evolutionary psychology, social structures, cultural conditioning, and economic systems. While these forces can lead to conformity and certain primitive behaviors, they also provide stability and coherence to societies. However, awareness of these influences can help individuals break free from them and think more critically and independently.
