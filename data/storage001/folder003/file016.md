# Remind me i really need to learn react today.

Got it! React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s component-based, which means you create small, reusable pieces of UI that you can combine to build more complex interfaces.

Here’s a quick overview to get you started:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Install Node.js if you haven’t already. Then, you can create a new React project using Create React App by running:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   npm start
   ```

   This will set up a new project and start a development server.

2. **Understand Components**: React components are the building blocks of a React application. You can create a component by defining a JavaScript function or class. For example:

   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
   }
   ```

   You can use this component in your app like this:

   ```jsx
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent'
   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <MyComponent />
       </div>
     )
   }
   export default App
   ```

3. **Learn JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It’s used to describe what the UI should look like. You write JSX inside your components.

4. **State and Props**:

   - **Props** are used to pass data from parent to child components.
   - **State** is used to manage data within a component. You can use the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components:
     ```jsx
     import { useState } from 'react'
     function Counter() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
         </div>
       )
     }
     ```

5. **Lifecycle Methods and Hooks**: Class components have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, but in functional components, you use hooks like `useEffect` to perform side effects:

   ```jsx
   import { useEffect } from 'react'
   function MyComponent() {
     useEffect(() => {
       // This runs once after the component mounts
       console.log('Component mounted')
     }, [])
     return <div>Hello</div>
   }
   ```

6. **Routing**: Use React Router to handle routing in your application:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```
   Example usage:
   ```jsx
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'
   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
           <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
         </Routes>
       </Router>
     )
   }
   ```
