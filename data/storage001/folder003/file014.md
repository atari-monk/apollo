# The problem is that, i have wrappers on soket.io in my library so that i dont need it as dependency there, othervise there is a conflict beetwen client that has library and sokectio, but i heard that if i use sokectIo as dev-dependecy than i can use it, wrapper is not nedeed and client will provide socket io to library, is that right ? So in my library package.json and in client, what should it look like for socket.io ? can u provide scheme ?

Certainly! Here's a clear scheme for how to set up `socket.io` in both your library and client `package.json` files to avoid conflicts and ensure proper integration.

### 1. **Library `package.json`**

In your library, you should handle `socket.io` as a `peerDependency` and also include it as a `devDependency` for development purposes.

```json
{
  "name": "your-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "socket.io": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "socket.io": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // other dependencies your library may have
  }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **`peerDependencies`**: Declares that your library is compatible with `socket.io` version 4.x. This ensures that the client project will install `socket.io` and provide it to your library.
- **`devDependencies`**: Allows you to develop and test your library with `socket.io` without bundling it into the final library that will be consumed by clients.

### 2. **Client `package.json`**

In the client project that uses your library, you need to explicitly install `socket.io` and your library.

```json
{
  "name": "client-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "your-library": "^1.0.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **`dependencies`**: The client project must install both your library and `socket.io`. This setup ensures that the client provides the necessary `socket.io` version that your library requires, resolving any potential conflicts.

### Workflow Recap:

1. **Library**: Defines `socket.io` as a `peerDependency` to ensure the client provides it and includes it in `devDependencies` for internal development.
2. **Client**: Explicitly installs `socket.io` alongside your library, ensuring that the correct version of `socket.io` is available and used consistently.

This setup prevents version conflicts and unnecessary duplication of the `socket.io` library, ensuring a smooth integration between your library and the client project.
