# Scene Documentation Template

Prompt: **Given this template in next prompt i will provide a scene description, fill template with it to produce documentation.**

```typescript
### **Scene Name:** `YourSceneName`

---

### **1. Scene Overview**
- **Description:**
  Briefly describe the purpose and functionality of the scene.
  _Example: This scene is designed to test the spriteRenderer system, handle sprite positioning, and demonstrate the use of sprite flipping._

- **Version:** `1.0.0`
  - Mention the version of the scene.

---

### **2. Key Features**
- **Primary Elements:**
  - List and explain the primary elements within the scene, such as sprites, objects, or UI components.

    - **Element 1: Player1**
      - **Position:** `430, 540`
      - **Description:** Rendered to show how spriteRenderer draws position from the top left of the sprite.
    - **Element 2: Player2**
      - **Position:** _Defined via transform.position._
      - **Description:** Rendered using the `sprite.spriteOffset` property to demonstrate sprite translation for centering.
    - **Element 3: Player3 and Player4**
      - **Position:** `Player1 and Player2` flipped horizontally with an x+100 translation.
      - **Description:** Used to test sprite flipping.

- **Core System Components:**
  - `spriteRenderer 1.0.0`
    - **Description:** Renders the transform position from the top-left corner of the sprite.
  - `canvasScaler`
    - **Description:** Handles scaling for the scene.

---

### **3. Behavior and Logic**
- **Special Behavior:**
  - **spriteRenderer Positioning:** The system renders `transform.position` as the top-left point of the sprite in version 1.0.0.
  - **sprite.spriteOffset:** Demonstrates how the spriteOffset property moves the sprite so that the transform.position is at the sprite's center.
  
- **Behavioral Notes:**
  - Initial decisions, such as the use of `sprite.spriteOffset`, were made early in development and are now considered suboptimal. Kept for historical purposes.
  
---

### **4. Usage and Configuration**
- **How to Load the Scene:**
  Provide instructions on how to configure and load this scene.

    ```json
    "select": {
        "folder": "engine",
        "subFolder": "",
        "scene": "renderer100"
    }
    ```

---

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - List any modules, systems, or third-party libraries required for the scene to function.
    _Example: Depends on the spriteRenderer system and canvasScaler._

- **Interactions with Other Systems:**
  - Describe how this scene interacts with other game systems, components, or scenes.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - Describe any issues or limitations in this scene.
    _Example: The sprite rendering method is inefficient due to the improper use of `sprite.spriteOffset`._
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Any assumptions made while designing the scene.
    _Example: Assumes that sprite flipping only affects horizontal orientation._

---

### **7. Historical Notes (Optional)**
- **Reasoning for Deprecated/Legacy Features:**
  - Explain why certain outdated features remain, even if they are no longer in use or optimal.
    _Example: Kept as a point of reference to show what not to do in future versions._
