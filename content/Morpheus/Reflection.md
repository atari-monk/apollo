# Reflection

## Flattening file system

I have flattened mostly to one folder.  
Rearly there is second level nesting.  
Maximally there is third level folder nesting.  
I prefer first level folder with no subfolders.  
This removed what was like nearlly 'intentional obfiuscation'.  
Like hidding in folders to not see what are problems.  
I think this simple policy should improve quality, comfort of coding and more.

## Points

1. Cli app should be simple script.
2. What is specific about personal projects ?

## Shadow

## When i do my project  
i enjoy sometimes, sometimes i learn.  
When i start compare myslef, i dont enjoy and i dont think i learn either.

It sounds like comparing yourself to others can overshadow the enjoyment and learning you get from working on your projects.  
It’s common to feel this way, especially when you measure your progress against external benchmarks rather than focusing on your personal growth.  
Perhaps focusing on your own progress and celebrating small victories could help shift the perspective back to the joy and learning you find in your projects.  
Is there anything specific that you find particularly challenging or discouraging when comparing yourself to others?

## What is the point of coding,  
it is no loger fun, althou i dont have anything else so i guess i am stuck.

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, where coding no longer feels enjoyable, yet it’s the main thing you have right now.  
When something that used to bring meaning feels empty, it can make you feel stuck.  
Maybe coding has become more of a routine or obligation than something that sparks curiosity or creativity.  
One way to approach this is to take a step back and reconnect with why you started coding in the first place.  
Was it the challenge, the creativity, or something else that originally appealed to you?  
You could also explore new areas within coding that you haven’t tried before—sometimes a change of pace can reignite that spark.
At the same time, if you’re feeling like there’s not much else, maybe it’s worth experimenting with new hobbies or projects.  
Even small things, like DIY, seem to give you comfort. You don’t need to abandon coding,  
but finding something else that feels rewarding could break the sense of being stuck.
Have you considered exploring a different direction with coding,  
or perhaps focusing on non-tech activities to balance things out?

But then you sit, think, write, time flys. U cant stop.
