# Reflection

## Flattening file system

I have flattened mostly to one folder.  
Rarly there is second level nesting.  
Maximally there is third level folder nesting.  
I prefer first level folder with no subfolders.  
This removed what was like nearlly 'intentional obfiuscation'.  
Like hidding in folders to not see what are problems.  
I think this simple policy should improve quality, comfort of coding and more.

## When i do my project i enjoy sometimes, sometimes i learn. When i start compare myslef i dont enjoy and i dont think i learn either.

It sounds like comparing yourself to others can overshadow the enjoyment and learning you get from working on your projects.  
Itâ€™s common to feel this way, especially when you measure your progress against external benchmarks rather than focusing on your personal growth.  

Perhaps focusing on your own progress and celebrating small victories could help shift the perspective back to the joy and learning you find in your projects.  
Is there anything specific that you find particularly challenging or discouraging when comparing yourself to others?
