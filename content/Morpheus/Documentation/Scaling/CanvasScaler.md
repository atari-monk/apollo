### **Class Name:** `CanvasScaler`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for managing the scaling of a canvas in response to window resizing events. It adjusts the canvas dimensions and scaling factors to maintain the intended aspect ratio.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `startEntity(entity: IEntity)`
      - **Description:** Initializes the canvas scaling for the given entity.
      - **Behavior:** Retrieves the `CanvasScale` component from the entity and sets up the resize handling.
      - **Returns:** None.
      - **Exceptions:** None noted.
  - `addResizeListener()`
      - **Description:** Attaches a listener for window resize events.
      - **Behavior:** Calls the `handleResize` method whenever the window is resized.
      - **Returns:** None.
  - `handleResize()`
      - **Description:** Adjusts the canvas size and updates the scaling factors.
      - **Behavior:** Updates the canvas dimensions to match the window size and recalculates the scale factor based on the original dimensions.
      - **Returns:** None.

- **Key Properties:**
  - `originalWidth`
      - **Description:** The original width of the canvas, used for scaling calculations.
      - **Behavior:** This is a fixed value (1920) that serves as a reference for the current canvas dimensions.
  - `originalHeight`
      - **Description:** The original height of the canvas, used for scaling calculations.
      - **Behavior:** This is a fixed value (1080) that serves as a reference for the current canvas dimensions.
  - `canvasScale`
      - **Description:** The `CanvasScale` component associated with the current entity.
      - **Behavior:** Used to store and manipulate the scaling factors based on the current canvas dimensions.

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Hereâ€™s how to use the `CanvasScaler` class in practice.

    ```typescript
    const canvasScaler = new CanvasScaler(entityCache, logger, canvasContext2D, eventSystem);
    canvasScaler.startEntity(entity);
    ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  This example demonstrates how the class reacts to window resizing.

    ```typescript
    // Assuming the window is resized
    window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));
    ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `ICanvasContext2D`: Interface for managing the canvas context.
  - `IEventSystem`: Interface for event management and publishing.
  - `IEntityCache`: Interface for caching entities.
  - `CanvasScale`: Component for managing the scaling factors of the canvas.
  - `IEntity`: Interface representing an entity in the ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.
  - `System`: Base class for ECS systems.
  - `ILogger`: Interface for logging system events.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  The `CanvasScaler` interacts with the `ICanvasContext2D` to modify the canvas dimensions and with `IEventSystem` to publish resize events. It also retrieves the `CanvasScale` component from entities to adjust their scale properties.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes a specific original canvas size (1920x1080) and may not behave as expected with different aspect ratios.
  - The class is designed for a single canvas and does not support multiple canvases or different scaling strategies.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the `CanvasScale` component exists on the entity passed to `startEntity`.
  - The resizing behavior relies on the window resize event, which may not cover all resizing scenarios (e.g., when the canvas is not visible).

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- The class is designed for use in environments where canvas scaling is necessary, such as games or interactive applications. Future improvements could include support for dynamic aspect ratios and additional event handling for different display configurations.
