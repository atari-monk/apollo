### **Class Name:** `TopLeftCollision`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**

- **Description:**
  This class implements a collision detection algorithm that checks for overlapping rectangles using the top-left corner method. It is responsible for determining if two rectangular colliders are colliding based on their positions and sizes.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**

- **Primary Methods:**

  - `start(collision: ICollision)`

    - **Description:** Initializes the internal rectangle representations using the positions and sizes of the two colliding objects.
    - **Behavior:** This method is called at the beginning of the collision check to set up the rectangles.
    - **Returns:** Nothing.

  - `isColliding(collision: ICollision): boolean`

    - **Description:** Checks if the two rectangles are colliding based on their positions and sizes.
    - **Behavior:** Calculates collision by comparing the position and size of both rectangles. Returns true if they overlap, false otherwise.
    - **Returns:** A boolean indicating whether the rectangles are colliding.

  - `draw(_collision: ICollision): void`
    - **Description:** A placeholder method for drawing or visualizing the collision (currently does nothing).
    - **Behavior:** Intended for future use; currently, it does not perform any operations.
    - **Returns:** Nothing.

- **Key Properties:**

  - `_rect1`

    - **Description:** Represents the first rectangle used in collision detection.
    - **Behavior:** It is initialized in the `start` method with the position and size of the first collider.

  - `_rect2`
    - **Description:** Represents the second rectangle used in collision detection.
    - **Behavior:** It is initialized in the `start` method with the position and size of the second collider.

### **3. Usage Examples**

- **Example 1:**
  Here is an example of how to use the `TopLeftCollision` class to check for collisions between two objects.

  ```javascript
  const collisionAlgorithm = new TopLeftCollision()
  const collisionData = {
    object1: {
      transform: { position: new Vector2(0, 0) },
      collider: { size: new Vector2(5, 5) },
    },
    object2: {
      transform: { position: new Vector2(3, 3) },
      collider: { size: new Vector2(5, 5) },
    },
  }

  collisionAlgorithm.start(collisionData)
  const isColliding = collisionAlgorithm.isColliding(collisionData)
  console.log(`Collision detected: ${isColliding}`)
  ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  An example of using the `draw` method (though it currently does nothing).

  ```javascript
  const collisionAlgorithm = new TopLeftCollision()
  const collisionData = {
    object1: {
      transform: { position: new Vector2(0, 0) },
      collider: { size: new Vector2(5, 5) },
    },
    object2: {
      transform: { position: new Vector2(3, 3) },
      collider: { size: new Vector2(5, 5) },
    },
  }

  collisionAlgorithm.start(collisionData)
  collisionAlgorithm.draw(collisionData) // Currently does nothing
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**

- **Dependencies:**

  - Imports `Vector2` for handling 2D vector mathematics.
  - Implements `ICollision` for defining collision data structure.
  - Implements `ICollisionAlgorithm` for defining the collision algorithm interface.
  - Uses `IRect` for rectangle structure.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - Interacts with collision objects that conform to the `ICollision` interface. It expects objects to have `transform` and `collider` properties.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**

- **Known Limitations:**

  - Currently, the `draw` method is not implemented and does not perform any actions.
  - The class relies on the caller to ensure that `start` is called before `isColliding`.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that the provided `ICollision` objects are valid and have the required properties defined.
  - Assumes the coordinates and sizes are in a compatible format for the collision detection logic.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**

- Future improvements could include implementing the `draw` method for visual feedback during collision detection.
- Consideration for rotation or non-axis-aligned rectangles may enhance the functionality of this class in future versions.
