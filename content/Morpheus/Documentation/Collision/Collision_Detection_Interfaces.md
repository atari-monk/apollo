### **Interface Group Name:** `CollisionDetection`

---

### **1. Group Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This group of interfaces is designed to facilitate collision detection and handling in a 2D game or simulation environment. It standardizes the representation of collision entities, algorithms, and callback mechanisms.

---

### **2. Common Responsibilities Across Interfaces**
- **Shared Purpose:**
  All interfaces in this group provide functionality for detecting and responding to collisions between game entities. They define the structure of collision data, algorithms to assess collisions, and callbacks to handle collision events.

---

### **3. Key Interfaces and Their Methods**

- **Interface Name:** `ICollision`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - **No explicit methods defined** (this interface serves as a data structure).

- **Interface Name:** `ICollisionAlgorithm`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `start(collision: ICollision): void`
      - **Description:** Initiates the collision algorithm with the given collision data.
      - **Behavior:** Prepares the algorithm to handle collision detection for the specified objects.
      - **Returns:** None.
    - `isColliding(collision: ICollision): boolean`
      - **Description:** Determines if the two objects represented in the collision data are currently colliding.
      - **Behavior:** Returns true if the objects intersect based on their rectangles; otherwise, false.
      - **Returns:** A boolean indicating collision status.
    - `draw(collision: ICollision): void`
      - **Description:** Renders the collision detection visuals, if applicable.
      - **Behavior:** May produce visual feedback for debugging or gameplay purposes.
      - **Returns:** None.

- **Interface Name:** `ICollisionCallback`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - **No explicit methods defined** (this interface serves as a function type).

- **Interface Name:** `ICollisionEntity`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - **No explicit methods defined** (this interface serves as a data structure).

- **Interface Name:** `IRect`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - **No explicit methods defined** (this interface serves as a data structure).

### **4. Usage Examples**

- **Example 1 (Basic Implementation):**
  Provide an example of how an interface from the group might be implemented in practice.

  ```typescript
  class MyCollisionAlgorithm implements ICollisionAlgorithm {
      start(collision: ICollision): void {
          // Initialize collision algorithm
      }

      isColliding(collision: ICollision): boolean {
          // Perform collision detection
          return true; // Example return
      }

      draw(collision: ICollision): void {
          // Draw collision visualization
      }
  }
  ```

- **Example 2 (Advanced Usage or Multiple Interfaces):**
  Show an example of using multiple interfaces together or implementing advanced features.

  ```typescript
  class MyCollisionEntity implements ICollisionEntity {
      entityId: string;
      transform: ITransform;
      collider: IBoxCollider;
      rigidBody: IRigidBody;

      constructor(entityId: string, transform: ITransform, collider: IBoxCollider, rigidBody: IRigidBody) {
          this.entityId = entityId;
          this.transform = transform;
          this.collider = collider;
          this.rigidBody = rigidBody;
      }
  }

  const collision: ICollision = {
      object1: new MyCollisionEntity('1', /* transform */, /* collider */, /* rigidBody */),
      object2: new MyCollisionEntity('2', /* transform */, /* collider */, /* rigidBody */),
      rect1: { position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, size: { x: 1, y: 1 }, halfSize: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 } },
      rect2: { position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, size: { x: 1, y: 1 }, halfSize: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 } },
      point1: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      point2: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  };
  ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - The interfaces depend on several components: `IVector2`, `IBoxCollider`, `IRigidBody`, and `ITransform` for their functionalities.

- **Interactions with Other Interfaces or Classes:**
  - Interfaces in this group interact primarily with each other to manage collision detection and response. For example, `ICollisionAlgorithm` uses `ICollision` to determine if two entities are colliding.

---

### **6. Variations and Extensibility**
- **Known Variations:**
  - Variations can exist in collision algorithms; for instance, some may handle bounding box collisions while others may deal with pixel-perfect collisions.

- **Extensibility:**
  - New interfaces can be added to extend the functionality for specialized collision scenarios, such as handling 3D collisions or different types of colliders.

---

### **7. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The interfaces do not provide methods for managing collision responses or effects; that functionality should be implemented externally.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It is assumed that all entities have valid transforms and colliders before collision checks are performed.

---

### **8. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Future versions of this group may include interfaces that support enhanced collision detection techniques, such as spatial partitioning methods for more efficient processing in large scenes.
