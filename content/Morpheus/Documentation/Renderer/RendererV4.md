### **Class Name:** `RendererV4`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  The `RendererV4` class is responsible for rendering animations and images on a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` using specific transformations such as scaling,  
  translating, and flipping. It manages the drawing of animation frames and supports both normal and horizontally flipped rendering.  
  **This is current version.**

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `drawNormal(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, canvasScale: IVector2, image: HTMLImageElement, frame: IAnimationFrame, transform: ITransform)`: 
    - **Description:** This method draws an image on a canvas at the specified position and scale, based on the given animation frame and transformation properties.
    - **Behavior:** The image is drawn using the specified frame dimensions and is centered on the transformation position. The image is rendered normally, without any flipping.
    - **Returns:** `void`
    - **Exceptions:** None
    
  - `drawFlipped(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, canvasScale: IVector2, image: HTMLImageElement, frame: IAnimationFrame, transform: ITransform)`: 
    - **Description:** This method draws a horizontally flipped image on a canvas, using the same parameters as `drawNormal`.
    - **Behavior:** The image is rendered with a horizontal flip, achieved by inverting the `x` scale value of the transformation.
    - **Returns:** `void`
    - **Exceptions:** None

- **Key Properties:**
  - `None`: This class does not have specific properties, as it relies solely on method parameters for rendering behavior.

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  ```typescript
  const renderer = new RendererV4();
  const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
  const canvasScale = { x: 1, y: 1 };
  const transform = { position: { x: 100, y: 100 }, scale: { x: 1, y: 1 } };
  const frame = { frameSize: { x: 64, y: 64 }, framePosition: { x: 0, y: 0 } };
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = 'path/to/image.png';

  // Draw the image normally
  renderer.drawNormal(context, canvasScale, image, frame, transform);
  ```

- **Example 2 (Flipped rendering):**
  ```typescript
  const transformFlipped = { position: { x: 100, y: 100 }, scale: { x: 1, y: 1 } };

  // Draw the image flipped horizontally
  renderer.drawFlipped(context, canvasScale, image, frame, transformFlipped);
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `CanvasRenderingContext2D`: The 2D rendering context from an HTML `<canvas>`.
  - `IVector2`: Represents a 2D vector used for positions and scaling.
  - `ITransform`: Represents the transformation (position and scale) applied to an object being rendered.
  - `IAnimationFrame`: Contains information about the specific frame to render, including its size and position in the image.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - The class interacts with `ITransform`, `IVector2`, and `IAnimationFrame` to determine the position, scaling, and specific frame details for rendering.
  - It utilizes the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface for drawing operations.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes that the provided image is fully loaded before rendering; it does not handle image loading errors or asynchronous behavior.
  - This class does not handle concurrent rendering scenarios. Each method invocation must be performed in a single-threaded environment.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - It is assumed that the transformation and animation frame data passed into the class is valid and pre-validated.
  - The rendering context (`ctx`) is valid and bound to a canvas element when the methods are invoked.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Future improvements could include support for more complex transformations (e.g., rotation) and error handling for missing or invalid images.
- The class is designed to be used with 2D canvas animations and may require extensions for 3D or more advanced rendering techniques.
