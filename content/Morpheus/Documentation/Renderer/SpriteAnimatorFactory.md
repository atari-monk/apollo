### **Class Name:** `SpriteAnimatorFactory`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for creating instances of `ISpriteAnimator` based on specified versioning and animation configurations. It utilizes different renderers for various versions to ensure compatibility and functionality in sprite animation.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `createSpriteAnimator(version: string, animationConfigs: IAnimationConfig[])`
      - **Description:** Creates a new instance of `ISpriteAnimator` based on the specified version and provided animation configurations.
      - **Behavior:** If an unsupported version is provided, it defaults to version '4.0.0' and logs a warning.
      - **Returns:** Returns an instance of `ISpriteAnimator` configured with the appropriate renderer and animation configurations.
      - **Exceptions:** No exceptions are explicitly thrown, but it logs a warning for unsupported versions.
  
- **Key Properties:**
  - `logger`
      - **Description:** An instance of `ILogger` used for logging warnings and information during the creation process.
      - **Behavior:** This property facilitates logging, which can help in debugging and monitoring the animator creation process.

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Demonstrates basic usage of the `SpriteAnimatorFactory` to create a sprite animator.

  ```typescript
  const logger = new SomeLoggerImplementation();
  const factory = new SpriteAnimatorFactory(logger);
  const animator = factory.createSpriteAnimator('2.0.0', animationConfigs);
  ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Shows how to handle an unsupported version by creating a default animator.

  ```typescript
  const animator = factory.createSpriteAnimator('5.0.0', animationConfigs);
  // Logs: "Version 5.0.0 not present. Default '4.0.0' set."
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - This class relies on the following modules:
    - `ILogger`: For logging messages during the animator creation process.
    - `IRenderer` and its implementations (`RendererV1`, `RendererV2`, `RendererV3`, `RendererV4`): For rendering the sprites.
    - `IAnimationConfig`: Represents the configuration for animations.
    - `ISpriteAnimator`: The interface for the sprite animator.
    - `SpriteAnimator`: The concrete implementation of `ISpriteAnimator`.
    - `CyclicAnimation` and `SequentialAnimation`: For managing animation sequences.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - This class interacts with multiple renderer classes to instantiate the appropriate rendering behavior based on versioning. It delegates the animation logic to the `SpriteAnimator` class, which uses both cyclic and sequential animation techniques.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - This class does not support creating sprite animators for versions other than '1.0.0', '2.0.0', '3.0.0', and '4.0.0'. Any other version defaults to '4.0.0'.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the provided `animationConfigs` are valid and appropriately structured to be used with the chosen `ISpriteAnimator`.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Future improvements could include supporting additional versions of renderers without modifying the existing logic. This could be achieved through a more dynamic registration mechanism for renderers or using a configuration file to manage versions. Compatibility with future animation systems could also be considered.
