### **Class Name:** `AnimationSwitcher`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for managing the switching of animations for multiple entities, responding to keyboard input to cycle through available animations.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
- `switchIt()`
    - **Description:** This private method increments the current animation index for each entity and publishes an event to update the animation in the event system.
    - **Behavior:** If the current animation index exceeds the length of the available animations, it wraps around to the first animation.
    - **Returns:** This method does not return a value.
    - **Exceptions:** No specific exceptions are thrown, but it assumes valid animation data is provided.

- **Key Properties:**
- `_eventSystem`
    - **Description:** An instance of `IEventSystem` that handles event publication for animation changes.
    - **Behavior:** Used to publish animation switch events when animations change.

- `_keyboardActionHandler`
    - **Description:** An instance of `KeyboardActionHandler` that captures keyboard inputs for switching animations.
    - **Behavior:** Initializes keyboard input handling by binding the `switchIt` method to the appropriate key events.

- `_animations`
    - **Description:** An array of `IAnimation` objects representing the entities and their animations.
    - **Behavior:** Each `IAnimation` object contains the entity ID, the current animation index, and an array of animation identifiers.

---

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
```typescript
const eventSystem = new EventSystem(); // Assume EventSystem implements IEventSystem
const keyboardHandler = new KeyboardActionHandler();
const animations = [
    { entityId: 'entity1', currentAnimation: 0, animations: [0, 1, 2] },
    { entityId: 'entity2', currentAnimation: 0, animations: [0, 1] }
];

const animationSwitcher = new AnimationSwitcher(eventSystem, keyboardHandler, animations);
```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
```typescript
const anotherAnimations = [
    { entityId: 'entity3', currentAnimation: 0, animations: [0, 1, 2, 3] }
];

const anotherSwitcher = new AnimationSwitcher(eventSystem, keyboardHandler, anotherAnimations);
// When a keyboard event occurs, animations will automatically switch.
```

---

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - This class relies on the `IEventSystem` interface for event management and the `KeyboardActionHandler` for handling keyboard inputs.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - The `AnimationSwitcher` interacts with the `IEventSystem` to publish events whenever an animation is switched. It also uses `KeyboardActionHandler` to bind keyboard actions to the animation switching functionality.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes that the `animations` array in each `IAnimation` object is not empty and that the `currentAnimation` index is always valid.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that keyboard events are correctly captured and that the animation data has been pre-validated before being passed into the class.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Consider implementing validation checks for the input data to ensure robustness, such as checking for valid entity IDs and non-empty animations arrays. Future improvements could include adding support for custom key bindings for different entities.
