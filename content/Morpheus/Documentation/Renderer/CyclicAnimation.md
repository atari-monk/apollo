### **Class Name:** `CyclicAnimation`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  The `CyclicAnimation` class implements an animation strategy that allows animations to cycle through their frames in both forward and backward directions. It manages frame timing and transitions based on elapsed time.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `update(deltaTime: number, state: AnimationState)`
      - **Description:** Updates the animation state based on the elapsed time (`deltaTime`) and the current animation state (`state`).
      - **Behavior:** Increments or decrements the current frame index based on the animation direction and resets the timer when the specified frame duration is reached. It toggles the direction of the animation when the end of the animation sequence is reached.
      - **Returns:** This method does not return a value.
      - **Exceptions:** No specific exceptions are thrown; however, it assumes valid state inputs.

- **Key Properties:**
  - (This class does not define properties; it primarily operates on the `AnimationState` passed to the `update` method.)

---

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Demonstrates how to use the `CyclicAnimation` class to update an animation state.

  ```typescript
  const animationState = new AnimationState();
  const cyclicAnimation = new CyclicAnimation();
  
  // Simulate a deltaTime for the update call
  const deltaTime = 0.016; // Approximately 60 FPS
  
  // Update the animation state
  cyclicAnimation.update(deltaTime, animationState);
  ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Illustrates a more advanced scenario with a predefined animation state.

  ```typescript
  const animationState = new AnimationState();
  animationState.currentAnimationIndex = 0;
  animationState.currentFrameIndex = 0;
  animationState.frameDurations = [100, 100]; // Duration for each frame
  animationState.animations = [[/* frames for animation 0 */]];
  animationState.isForward = true;

  const cyclicAnimation = new CyclicAnimation();
  
  // Update the animation multiple times to see the frame change
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      cyclicAnimation.update(deltaTime, animationState);
      console.log(animationState.currentFrameIndex); // Log the current frame index
  }
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - This class relies on the `IAnimationStrategy` interface for type checking.
  - It also depends on the `AnimationState` class, which holds the current state of the animation.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - The `CyclicAnimation` class interacts with the `AnimationState` class to manage the current frame and the animation direction. It assumes that `AnimationState` is updated independently elsewhere in the application.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The `CyclicAnimation` class does not support concurrent updates and should be called from a single thread to avoid inconsistent state behavior.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the `AnimationState` object passed to the `update` method is properly initialized and contains valid frame durations and animations.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- This class is designed for basic cyclic animations and may be extended for more complex animation behaviors in the future. Consider adding support for event callbacks when an animation completes or when direction changes.
