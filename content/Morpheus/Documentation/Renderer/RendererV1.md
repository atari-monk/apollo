### **Class Name:** `RendererV1`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**  
  The `RendererV1` class is responsible for rendering image frames on an HTML canvas. It provides methods to draw both normal and horizontally flipped frames of an image onto the canvas. This is typically used for animating sprites in a 2D game or graphical application.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**

  - `drawNormal(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, image: HTMLImageElement, frame: IAnimationFrame, position: IVector2): void`  
    - **Description:** Draws a specified frame from the image at the given position on the canvas without any transformations.
    - **Behavior:**  
      - Draws the image directly from the specified frame and places it at the specified position on the canvas.
      - No scaling or rotation is applied, other than the frame cropping itself.
    - **Returns:** This method doesn't return a value.
    - **Exceptions:** Throws an error if the canvas context (`ctx`), image, or frame are invalid.
  
  - `drawFlipped(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, image: HTMLImageElement, frame: IAnimationFrame, position: IVector2): void`  
    - **Description:** Draws a horizontally flipped frame of the image at the given position on the canvas.
    - **Behavior:**  
      - First saves the current canvas context state.
      - Translates the canvas horizontally, scales the image to flip it horizontally, and then draws the image.
      - Restores the canvas state after drawing to avoid affecting subsequent draw calls.
    - **Returns:** This method doesn't return a value.
    - **Exceptions:** Throws an error if the canvas context (`ctx`), image, or frame are invalid.

- **Key Properties:**
  - The `RendererV1` class doesn't expose any properties directly, focusing solely on its rendering methods.

### **3. Usage Examples**

- **Example 1:**  
  Rendering an image frame normally at a specific position.

  ```javascript
  const renderer = new RendererV1();
  const frame = { framePosition: { x: 0, y: 0 }, frameSize: { x: 32, y: 32 } }; // Example frame object
  const position = { x: 100, y: 150 }; // Example position
  renderer.drawNormal(ctx, image, frame, position);
  ```

- **Example 2:**  
  Rendering a flipped image frame horizontally at a given position.

  ```javascript
  const renderer = new RendererV1();
  const frame = { framePosition: { x: 0, y: 0 }, frameSize: { x: 32, y: 32 } }; // Example frame object
  const position = { x: 200, y: 150 }; // Example position
  renderer.drawFlipped(ctx, image, frame, position);
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**

- **Dependencies:**  
  - `IAnimationFrame`: Defines the structure for animation frames, specifying the position and size of the frame within the image.
  - `IVector2`: Interface for a 2D vector, used for representing positions and dimensions.
  - `Vector2`: Class for 2D vector operations. Used to perform operations like flipping and positioning.
  - `CanvasRenderingContext2D`: Native canvas API for 2D drawing.
  - `HTMLImageElement`: Represents the image to be rendered.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**  
  - Interacts with the `IAnimationFrame` interface to access frame data (position and size within the image).
  - Uses `IVector2` for determining the position on the canvas.
  - Utilizes `Vector2.zero` in `drawFlipped()` to reset the position after translating for flipping.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**

- **Known Limitations:**  
  - This class only supports 2D rendering; it doesn't handle 3D transformations or rotations.
  - The flipping operation only works horizontally; vertical flipping isn't supported.
  - Does not handle image loading or resource management; assumes the image is fully loaded before rendering.
  - No error handling is provided for invalid frame or position inputs.

- **Assumptions:**  
  - Assumes the canvas context (`ctx`) is properly initialized before calling the rendering methods.
  - The input `IAnimationFrame` and `IVector2` objects are well-formed and valid when passed to the methods.
  - Assumes `Vector2.zero` provides a valid zero vector for position resetting during flipped rendering.

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**

- Future improvements might include adding support for vertical flipping or additional transformations like scaling and rotating frames.
- Could also extend to handle animations directly, rather than relying on external animation frame management.
