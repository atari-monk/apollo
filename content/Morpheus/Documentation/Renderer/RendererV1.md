### **Class Name:** `RendererV1`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**

- **Description:**  
  The `RendererV1` class is responsible for rendering image frames onto an HTML canvas. It supports drawing both normal and horizontally flipped frames, which is commonly used for rendering sprite animations in 2D games or graphical applications. This class is used in conjunction with `SpriteAnimator` to render animated frames based on the animation state.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**

- **Primary Methods:**

  - `drawNormal(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, image: HTMLImageElement, frame: IAnimationFrame, position: IVector2): void`
    - **Description:** Draws a specific frame from the image at the given position on the canvas without any transformation or flipping.
    - **Behavior:**  
      - Crops the image based on the `frame`'s position and size, then draws it at the specified position on the canvas.  
      - No scaling or rotation is applied; it uses the exact dimensions provided by the `frame`.
    - **Returns:** This method does not return a value.
    - **Exceptions:** Throws an error if the canvas context (`ctx`), image, or frame are invalid (e.g., undefined or improperly formatted).
  
  - `drawFlipped(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, image: HTMLImageElement, frame: IAnimationFrame, position: IVector2): void`
    - **Description:** Draws a horizontally flipped frame of the image at the specified position on the canvas.
    - **Behavior:**  
      - Saves the current state of the canvas context.
      - Translates the canvas to the position of the sprite and horizontally flips it by scaling with `(-1, 1)`.
      - Calls `drawNormal()` to render the flipped frame.
      - Restores the canvas state after drawing to prevent the flip from affecting other operations.
    - **Returns:** This method does not return a value.
    - **Exceptions:** Throws an error if the canvas context (`ctx`), image, or frame are invalid.

- **Key Properties:**  
  - `RendererV1` does not have any public properties. It only exposes its two rendering methods (`drawNormal` and `drawFlipped`).

---

### **3. Usage Examples**

- **Example 1:**  
  Rendering an image frame normally at a specific position.

  ```javascript
  const renderer = new RendererV1();
  const frame = { framePosition: { x: 0, y: 0 }, frameSize: { x: 32, y: 32 } }; // Example frame object
  const position = { x: 100, y: 150 }; // Example position on the canvas
  renderer.drawNormal(ctx, image, frame, position);
  ```

- **Example 2:**  
  Rendering a flipped image frame horizontally at a given position.

  ```javascript
  const renderer = new RendererV1();
  const frame = { framePosition: { x: 0, y: 0 }, frameSize: { x: 32, y: 32 } }; // Example frame object
  const position = { x: 200, y: 150 }; // Example position on the canvas
  renderer.drawFlipped(ctx, image, frame, position);
  ```

- **Engine Usage:**  
  This class is typically used in conjunction with `SpriteAnimator::draw` to handle the actual rendering of animation frames. The `drawNormal()` and `drawFlipped()` methods are called depending on the animation state (whether the sprite needs to be mirrored or not).

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**

- **Dependencies:**  
  - `IAnimationFrame`: Defines the frame's position and size within the sprite sheet.
  - `IVector2`: Represents 2D vector data, used for positions and dimensions (e.g., the `position` on the canvas).
  - `Vector2`: Implements vector operations and is used for position resets when flipping (e.g., `Vector2.zero` for zeroing the position).
  - `CanvasRenderingContext2D`: Part of the native canvas API, providing the context in which rendering operations take place.
  - `HTMLImageElement`: Represents the image resource that is drawn on the canvas, typically a sprite sheet.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**  
  - Works with `SpriteAnimator` to render animation frames, with `SpriteAnimator` determining the current animation state and passing the correct frame and position to `RendererV1`.
  - Utilizes the `Vector2.zero` constant in `drawFlipped()` to reset the position after flipping transformations.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**

- **Known Limitations:**  
  - Only supports 2D rendering and horizontal flipping. Vertical flipping and other transformations (e.g., rotation) are not supported.
  - The class does not handle any scaling of the image frames; the frame is drawn at the exact size specified in `frameSize`.
  - No resource management is provided; the image must be fully loaded before calling the rendering methods.
  - No error handling for invalid frame or position inputs (e.g., null or undefined values).

- **Assumptions:**  
  - The canvas context (`ctx`) is valid and initialized before invoking any rendering operations.
  - The `IAnimationFrame` and `IVector2` objects passed to the methods are well-formed and contain valid data (i.e., they follow the expected format and structure).
  - Assumes `Vector2.zero` provides a correct zero-vector for resetting positions during flipped rendering.
  - The sprite sheet is already preloaded and available in the `HTMLImageElement` (`image`).

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**

- Future improvements might include:
  - Adding vertical flipping or rotation support to enhance the rendering flexibility.
  - Scaling transformations for sprites.
  - Direct integration with the animation frame management system, reducing the reliance on external classes like `SpriteAnimator` for handling animation states.
  - Error handling for more robust use, ensuring invalid inputs (e.g., malformed frames) are handled gracefully.
