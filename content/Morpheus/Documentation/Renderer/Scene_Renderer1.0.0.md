### **Scene Name:** `renderer100`

---

### **1. Scene Overview**
- **Description:**
  This scene was created to test the `spriteRenderer` system and show how sprites are positioned using the `transform.position` and `sprite.spriteOffset` properties. It also demonstrates sprite flipping and the evolution of design decisions. The scene showcases the behavior of the sprite renderer in version `1.0.0` and highlights issues with the implementation, serving as a learning reference for what not to do.
  
- **Version:** `1.0.0`

---

### **2. Key Features**
- **Primary Elements:**
    - **Player1:**
      - **Position:** `430, 540`
      - **Description:** Rendered to show how `spriteRenderer 1.0.0` treats `transform.position` as the top-left corner of the sprite.
      
    - **Player2:**
      - **Position:** Set via `transform.position`.
      - **Description:** This sprite uses the `sprite.spriteOffset` property to shift the sprite so that the `transform.position` corresponds to the center of the sprite.
      
    - **Player3 and Player4:**
      - **Position:** Flipped versions of `Player1` and `Player2`, moved by `x + 100`.
      - **Description:** These sprites are rendered to test the sprite flipping functionality.

- **Core System Components:**
  - **spriteRenderer 1.0.0:**
    - **Description:** Renders `transform.position` as the top-left point of the sprite.
  
  - **canvasScaler:**
    - **Description:** Handles the scaling of the scene, ensuring consistent display across different resolutions and screen sizes.

### **3. Behavior and Logic**
- **Special Behavior:**
  - **spriteRenderer Positioning:** In version `1.0.0`, `spriteRenderer` renders the sprite's position using the top-left corner of the sprite as the reference point.
  
  - **sprite.spriteOffset:** The `sprite.spriteOffset` property is used to shift the sprite so that the `transform.position` represents the center of the sprite. This approach was later deemed inefficient and not ideal, but remains in version `1.0.0` for reference.

- **Behavioral Notes:**
  - This scene reflects early development choices, such as the use of `sprite.spriteOffset` for centering sprites, which is now considered a poor decision. These choices were kept in this version as an example of design flaws to avoid in future versions.

### **4. Usage and Configuration**
- **How to Load the Scene:**
  To select this scene in the game or engine, configure it by passing the following JSON configuration:

    ```json
    "select": {
        "folder": "engine",
        "subFolder": "",
        "scene": "renderer100"
    }
    ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - **spriteRenderer 1.0.0:** Responsible for rendering sprites and managing their position on the screen.
  - **canvasScaler:** Ensures proper scaling of the scene for various screen sizes.

- **Interactions with Other Systems:**
  - Interacts with the core rendering system and scaling components to manage the display of the scene.
  - This scene interacts minimally with other systems and serves as a test case for sprite rendering behavior.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The use of `sprite.spriteOffset` to center sprites is an inefficient design, making the sprite system more complex and unintuitive. 
  - The scene does not handle concurrent access or multi-threaded environments and is designed for single-threaded execution.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It is assumed that the sprite flipping mechanism only applies to horizontal flipping and does not affect vertical orientation or other transformations.

---

### **7. Historical Notes (Optional)**
- **Reasoning for Deprecated/Legacy Features:**
  - Although the use of `sprite.spriteOffset` was later deemed a poor design choice, it is retained in version `1.0.0` to demonstrate early development assumptions. This scene serves as a reference for what not to do in future versions.
  - The scene also reflects early experiments with sprite flipping and positioning, highlighting the learning process involved in developing a functional spriteRenderer system.
