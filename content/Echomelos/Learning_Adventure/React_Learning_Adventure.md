### React Learning Adventure

Teach me react in adventure spanned for 10 days.  
1 day per prompt.

### Day 1: **Introduction to React and Setup**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, you'll step into the world of React, understanding its purpose and setting up the development environment. React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, specifically single-page applications (SPAs).

#### Objective:

- Understand **what React is**, why it's used, and how it works.
- Set up your development environment.

#### Tasks:

1. **What is React?**

   - React is a **component-based library**. Components are reusable pieces of UI.
   - It efficiently updates and renders the right components when your data changes.

2. **Why React?**

   - **Fast & Scalable**: React efficiently updates and renders only the necessary components.
   - **Reusable Components**: Code can be broken down into reusable pieces, leading to clean, maintainable code.
   - **Declarative**: You describe how the UI should look, and React handles the rest.

3. **Setting Up React Development Environment**

   - Install **Node.js**: You'll need Node.js to run React.
     - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   - Install **VS Code** or any code editor of your choice. [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

4. **Create Your First React App**

   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-react-adventure
     cd my-react-adventure
     npm start
     ```
   - This will set up a new React project and start a local development server. The app should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Explore the Structure**

   - Inside the `src` folder, you'll find key files:
     - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
     - `App.js`: Main component that renders the UI.

6. **Homework**: Take a few moments to navigate the default project created. Open `App.js` and modify some of the JSX (you’ll learn more about JSX tomorrow) to display your custom message, e.g., "Welcome to my React Adventure."

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You now know what React is and why it's useful.
- You set up your first React app and are ready to dive deeper!

Get ready for **Day 2**, where you'll learn about **components and JSX**.

### Day 2: **Components and JSX**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, you'll dive deeper into React's core building blocks: **Components** and **JSX**. Components let you split your UI into independent, reusable parts, while JSX is the syntax extension that makes writing React components easier.

#### Objective:

- Learn about **React Components**.
- Understand **JSX** (JavaScript XML).

#### Tasks:

1. **What is a Component?**

   - A component in React is simply a **JavaScript function** or **class** that returns JSX.
   - There are two main types of components:
     - **Functional Components**: Written as JavaScript functions.
     - **Class Components**: Written using ES6 classes (not as common in modern React).

   Here's an example of a **functional component**:

   ```jsx
   function Welcome() {
     return <h1>Welcome to React Adventure!</h1>
   }
   ```

   You can use this component anywhere in your app by calling `<Welcome />`.

2. **JSX Explained**:

   - **JSX** is a syntax extension of JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but is compiled to JavaScript under the hood.
   - With JSX, you can write HTML-like code in JavaScript files.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
   ```

   - JSX must return **a single parent element**, so if you want to return multiple elements, wrap them in a `<div>` or use a **React Fragment** (`<>`).

   ```jsx
   return (
     <>
       <h1>Title</h1>
       <p>Some description.</p>
     </>
   )
   ```

3. **Building Your First Custom Component**:

   - Open `App.js` and create a new component called `Greeting`:
     ```jsx
     function Greeting() {
       return <h1>Hello, React Adventurer!</h1>
     }
     ```
   - Now render the `Greeting` component inside `App`:
     ```jsx
     function App() {
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <Greeting />
         </div>
       )
     }
     ```
   - Your app will now display "Hello, React Adventurer!" on the screen.

4. **JSX Expressions**:

   - You can embed **JavaScript expressions** inside JSX by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`.
     Example:

   ```jsx
   const name = 'Adventurer'
   const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
   ```

5. **Passing Props to Components**:

   - Props are arguments you pass into components. They are used to make components more dynamic.
     Example:

   ```jsx
   function Greeting(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
   }

   function App() {
     return <Greeting name="React Explorer" />
   }
   ```

   - In this example, `props.name` takes the value of `"React Explorer"` and displays it in the greeting.

6. **Homework**:
   - Create two more components: `AdventureStart` and `AdventureEnd`.
   - `AdventureStart` should display a welcome message, and `AdventureEnd` should display a message indicating the end of the adventure.
   - Render both components inside `App.js`, and pass custom props (such as a custom message) to each.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You understand the structure of **React Components**.
- You've been introduced to **JSX**, which allows you to write UI elements as JavaScript expressions.
- You learned how to pass **props** to components.

Prepare yourself for **Day 3**, where we'll cover **state management** and dynamic behavior in components!

### Day 3: **State and Handling Events**

#### Adventure Task:

Today’s journey will guide you through React’s **state** system and how to handle **events**. State lets components hold and manage changing data, while events enable you to respond to user actions like clicks, form submissions, etc.

#### Objective:

- Understand **React state** and how to use it.
- Learn to handle **events** in React components.

#### Tasks:

1. **What is State in React?**

   - **State** is a built-in object that allows components to store and manage data that can change over time.
   - Each component can have its own state.
   - State is used to make components **dynamic** and **interactive**.

2. **Using the `useState` Hook**:

   - In functional components, you use the `useState` hook to add state.
   - `useState` returns two things:
     - The current state value.
     - A function to update the state.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react'

   function Counter() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

     return (
       <div>
         <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

   - In this example:
     - `useState(0)` initializes the `count` state to `0`.
     - `setCount` updates the state when the button is clicked.

3. **Handling Events**:

   - Events in React are handled similarly to JavaScript but with some key differences.
     - Event names in React are camelCased (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`).
     - You pass the event handler as a function, not a string.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function App() {
     const handleClick = () => {
       alert('Button clicked!')
     }

     return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
   }
   ```

4. **State and Props Together**:

   - You can pass state as props to child components to make them interactive.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function Child({ count }) {
     return <p>Count in child: {count}</p>
   }

   function Parent() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Parent count: {count}</p>
         <Child count={count} />
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

5. **Handling Forms and Input State**:

   - Often, you’ll want to manage form input values in state.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function FormComponent() {
     const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')

     const handleInputChange = (event) => {
       setInputValue(event.target.value)
     }

     return (
       <div>
         <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
         <p>You typed: {inputValue}</p>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

6. **Homework**:
   - Build a component called `AdventureProgress`.
   - Inside this component, create two buttons: "Start Adventure" and "End Adventure".
   - Use the `useState` hook to toggle between a "Starting your adventure..." message and an "Adventure complete!" message when the respective buttons are clicked.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You now understand how to use **state** to manage dynamic data in React.
- You learned how to **handle events** like clicks.
- You've practiced using state with props to make components interactive.

Prepare for **Day 4**, where we will learn about **conditional rendering** and more advanced component behavior!

### Day 4: **Conditional Rendering and Lists**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, we’ll cover how to conditionally render components based on state and data, and how to efficiently display lists of items. This will make your app dynamic, letting it react to different situations and display multiple items seamlessly.

#### Objective:

- Learn **conditional rendering** to show or hide components based on state or props.
- Understand how to render **lists** in React and use the `key` attribute.

#### Tasks:

1. **Conditional Rendering**:

   - Conditional rendering in React works like conditions in JavaScript. You can use JavaScript operators like `if`, `else`, and `ternary operators` to control what gets rendered.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureStatus({ isAdventureStarted }) {
     if (isAdventureStarted) {
       return <h1>Adventure is ongoing!</h1>
     }
     return <h1>Adventure not started yet!</h1>
   }

   function App() {
     const [started, setStarted] = useState(false)

     return (
       <div>
         <AdventureStatus isAdventureStarted={started} />
         <button onClick={() => setStarted(true)}>Start Adventure</button>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

   - In this example, the `AdventureStatus` component conditionally renders a message based on the `isAdventureStarted` prop.

2. **Ternary Operator**:

   - You can also use the ternary operator to make your code more concise:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureStatus({ isAdventureStarted }) {
     return isAdventureStarted ? (
       <h1>Adventure is ongoing!</h1>
     ) : (
       <h1>Adventure not started yet!</h1>
     )
   }
   ```

3. **Short-Circuit Evaluation**:

   - If you only need to render something based on one condition (e.g., show something if `true` and nothing otherwise), you can use short-circuit evaluation:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureDetails({ showDetails }) {
     return <div>{showDetails && <p>Here are your adventure details!</p>}</div>
   }
   ```

4. **Rendering Lists**:

   - To render a list of items in React, you can use JavaScript’s `map()` function.
   - When rendering a list, **each item must have a unique `key`** to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureList() {
     const adventures = ['Forest Quest', 'Desert Expedition', 'Mountain Climb']

     return (
       <ul>
         {adventures.map((adventure, index) => (
           <li key={index}>{adventure}</li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     )
   }
   ```

5. **The `key` Prop**:

   - The `key` prop is crucial for efficient rendering in lists. It helps React track which items have changed.
   - The key should be something unique to each item (like an `id`). Using the index as the key works for simple cases but isn’t ideal when items can be reordered or removed.

6. **Dynamic Lists with State**:

   - Let’s make a dynamic list where you can add items to the adventure list.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureList() {
     const [adventures, setAdventures] = useState([
       'Forest Quest',
       'Desert Expedition',
     ])
     const [newAdventure, setNewAdventure] = useState('')

     const addAdventure = () => {
       setAdventures([...adventures, newAdventure])
       setNewAdventure('')
     }

     return (
       <div>
         <ul>
           {adventures.map((adventure, index) => (
             <li key={index}>{adventure}</li>
           ))}
         </ul>
         <input
           type="text"
           value={newAdventure}
           onChange={(e) => setNewAdventure(e.target.value)}
         />
         <button onClick={addAdventure}>Add Adventure</button>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

7. **Homework**:
   - Create a component called `AdventureToggler` that displays a list of adventure names (use an array for this).
   - Add a button to toggle between showing and hiding the list.
   - Use the `map()` function to render the list and apply conditional rendering to show or hide it based on state.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You now understand how to implement **conditional rendering** to display different UI based on state or props.
- You learned how to efficiently render **lists** using the `map()` function and the importance of using **keys** for list items.

On **Day 5**, we’ll delve into **lifting state up** and how to share data between components!

### Day 5: **Lifting State Up and Sharing Data Between Components**

#### Adventure Task:

Today's journey will teach you how to share data between components by **lifting state up**. You’ll often need components to share state or interact, so lifting state allows parent components to manage state and pass it down as **props** to child components.

#### Objective:

- Understand **lifting state up** to share data between components.
- Practice passing **props** to components to manage shared data.

#### Tasks:

1. **What is Lifting State Up?**

   - In React, data flow is one-way (from parent to child). To share state between components, you **lift the state up** to the closest common ancestor and then pass the state as **props** to child components.
   - This allows sibling components to share and sync data through their parent.

2. **Example: Lifting State Up**

   - Suppose you have two components: `TemperatureInput` (to enter temperature) and `BoilingVerdict` (to show whether the water is boiling).
   - Instead of each component managing its own state, you can lift the state up to a parent component.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function BoilingVerdict({ celsius }) {
     if (celsius >= 100) {
       return <p>The water is boiling!</p>
     }
     return <p>The water is not boiling.</p>
   }

   function TemperatureInput({ celsius, onTemperatureChange }) {
     return (
       <fieldset>
         <legend>Enter temperature in Celsius:</legend>
         <input
           type="number"
           value={celsius}
           onChange={(e) => onTemperatureChange(e.target.value)}
         />
       </fieldset>
     )
   }

   function Calculator() {
     const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('')

     return (
       <div>
         <TemperatureInput
           celsius={temperature}
           onTemperatureChange={setTemperature}
         />
         <BoilingVerdict celsius={parseFloat(temperature)} />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

   - In this example:
     - The `Calculator` component holds the shared **state** (`temperature`) and passes it down to both `TemperatureInput` and `BoilingVerdict` as **props**.
     - `TemperatureInput` can modify the state via the `onTemperatureChange` prop, while `BoilingVerdict` renders based on the current temperature.

3. **Why Lift State Up?**

   - Lifting state up allows **multiple components** to share the same data and stay in sync.
   - If sibling components need to communicate, lift the state up to their common parent, and the parent can pass down updated state.

4. **Sharing Data Across Components Example**:

   - Let’s create a **task list** where users can add new tasks and mark tasks as complete.
   - You’ll have two components:
     - `TaskInput` for adding tasks.
     - `TaskList` for displaying tasks.
   - State for the tasks will be lifted up to the parent `App` component.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function TaskInput({ onAddTask }) {
     const [task, setTask] = useState('')

     const handleSubmit = (e) => {
       e.preventDefault()
       if (task) {
         onAddTask(task)
         setTask('')
       }
     }

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <input
           type="text"
           value={task}
           onChange={(e) => setTask(e.target.value)}
           placeholder="Add a task"
         />
         <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
       </form>
     )
   }

   function TaskList({ tasks }) {
     return (
       <ul>
         {tasks.map((task, index) => (
           <li key={index}>{task}</li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     )
   }

   function App() {
     const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([])

     const addTask = (newTask) => {
       setTasks([...tasks, newTask])
     }

     return (
       <div>
         <TaskInput onAddTask={addTask} />
         <TaskList tasks={tasks} />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

   - Here:
     - The `App` component manages the **task list** state.
     - The `TaskInput` component is responsible for adding new tasks and passing them up to the `App` component.
     - The `TaskList` component displays the list of tasks passed down as **props**.

5. **Props-Drilling**:

   - As you’ve seen, you may need to pass props through several components if they are deeply nested. This is known as **props-drilling**.
   - We will explore more advanced patterns to avoid excessive props-drilling later on (such as **Context API**), but for now, this is a good pattern to understand state management.

6. **Homework**:
   - Build a small **Adventure Tracker** app:
     - It should have a component to add new adventures (with a name and description).
     - Another component should display a list of added adventures.
     - **Lift the state up** to the parent component, so that the list is updated when a new adventure is added.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You now understand **lifting state up** to manage shared data between components.
- You've seen how parent components can hold state and pass it down to child components as **props**.

Prepare for **Day 6**, where we’ll dive into **React lifecycle methods** and explore how components manage mounting, updating, and unmounting behavior!

### Day 6: **React Component Lifecycle and Effects**

#### Adventure Task:

Today’s focus is understanding the **component lifecycle** and how React components manage behavior during different stages like mounting, updating, and unmounting. We'll also introduce the **`useEffect`** hook, which lets you run side effects in functional components.

#### Objective:

- Learn about **React's component lifecycle**.
- Understand and use the **`useEffect` hook** to manage side effects.

#### Tasks:

1. **What is the Component Lifecycle?**

   - React components go through several stages during their life:
     - **Mounting**: When the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
     - **Updating**: When the component's state or props change, causing it to re-render.
     - **Unmounting**: When the component is removed from the DOM.

   In class components, lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` are used to handle these stages. In functional components, **`useEffect`** replaces these methods.

2. **The `useEffect` Hook**:

   - `useEffect` is a hook that allows you to perform **side effects** in functional components, like fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions.
   - By default, `useEffect` runs after every render, but you can control when it runs using dependencies.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

   function Timer() {
     const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0)

     useEffect(() => {
       const interval = setInterval(() => {
         setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1)
       }, 1000)

       // Clean up when component unmounts
       return () => clearInterval(interval)
     }, []) // Empty array means effect runs only on mount and unmount

     return <p>Time passed: {seconds} seconds</p>
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `useEffect(() => {...}, [])` runs only once when the component mounts.
     - Returning a function from `useEffect` cleans up the effect when the component unmounts (here, clearing the interval).

3. **Effect Dependencies**:

   - You can pass **dependencies** to `useEffect` to control when it runs. The effect will re-run only when any value in the dependencies array changes.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     document.title = `Time: ${seconds}`
   }, [seconds]) // Only runs when `seconds` changes
   ```

   - If you omit the dependencies array, the effect will run **after every render**.

4. **Fetching Data with `useEffect`**:

   - A common use case for `useEffect` is fetching data from an API when the component mounts.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function DataFetcher() {
     const [data, setData] = useState([])
     const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

     useEffect(() => {
       fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
         .then((response) => response.json())
         .then((data) => {
           setData(data)
           setLoading(false)
         })
     }, []) // Only fetch once when component mounts

     if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>

     return (
       <ul>
         {data.map((item) => (
           <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     )
   }
   ```

5. **Cleaning Up Effects**:

   - It's important to clean up side effects when components unmount to avoid memory leaks. As shown in the timer example, we clean up the interval in the return statement inside `useEffect`.
   - This is useful for effects like setting timers, event listeners, or subscriptions.

6. **Multiple `useEffect` Hooks**:

   - You can have **multiple `useEffect`** hooks in a component to manage different effects separately.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function Component() {
     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('Component mounted')
     }, []) // Only on mount

     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('Component re-rendered')
     }) // On every render

     return <p>Hello, World!</p>
   }
   ```

7. **Homework**:
   - Build a component called `AdventureTimer`.
     - This component should display a timer that starts counting when the adventure begins.
     - Use `useEffect` to start the timer and clean it up when the component unmounts.
     - Add a button that starts and stops the timer, managing the component’s mount/unmount.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You now understand the **React component lifecycle**.
- You’ve learned how to use the **`useEffect` hook** to manage side effects like data fetching, updating the DOM, or cleaning up resources.
- You know how to control when effects run with **dependencies**.

Prepare for **Day 7**, where we’ll explore **React forms, validation**, and how to handle complex user inputs!

### Day 7: **Forms and Handling User Input**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, we will explore **React forms** and handling user input, a crucial part of building interactive apps. You’ll learn how to handle form submissions, manage multiple input fields, and perform basic validation.

#### Objective:

- Learn how to manage **controlled components** in forms.
- Understand how to handle **form submissions**.
- Explore basic **form validation** in React.

#### Tasks:

1. **Controlled Components**:

   - In React, input fields are typically **controlled components**. This means their value is controlled by React state.
   - The value of the input is set by the component’s state, and updates to the input trigger state changes.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function SimpleForm() {
     const [name, setName] = useState('')

     const handleChange = (event) => {
       setName(event.target.value)
     }

     return (
       <form>
         <label>
           Name:
           <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
         </label>
         <p>Your name is: {name}</p>
       </form>
     )
   }
   ```

   - The **`value`** of the input is linked to the state `name`, making it a controlled component.
   - When the input changes, `handleChange` updates the state, and the UI reflects the new value.

2. **Handling Form Submissions**:

   - You often need to handle form submissions, typically by preventing the default behavior (reloading the page) and performing some action like sending data to an API.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function SignUpForm() {
     const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
     const [password, setPassword] = useState('')

     const handleSubmit = (event) => {
       event.preventDefault()
       console.log('Email:', email, 'Password:', password)
     }

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <label>
           Email:
           <input
             type="email"
             value={email}
             onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
           />
         </label>
         <br />
         <label>
           Password:
           <input
             type="password"
             value={password}
             onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
           />
         </label>
         <br />
         <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
       </form>
     )
   }
   ```

   - The `handleSubmit` function prevents the default form submission behavior and logs the email and password when the form is submitted.

3. **Handling Multiple Inputs**:

   - When dealing with multiple form fields, you can store all input values in a **single state object**.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function ProfileForm() {
     const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
       firstName: '',
       lastName: '',
       age: '',
     })

     const handleChange = (event) => {
       const { name, value } = event.target
       setFormData((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }))
     }

     const handleSubmit = (event) => {
       event.preventDefault()
       console.log(formData)
     }

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <label>
           First Name:
           <input
             type="text"
             name="firstName"
             value={formData.firstName}
             onChange={handleChange}
           />
         </label>
         <br />
         <label>
           Last Name:
           <input
             type="text"
             name="lastName"
             value={formData.lastName}
             onChange={handleChange}
           />
         </label>
         <br />
         <label>
           Age:
           <input
             type="number"
             name="age"
             value={formData.age}
             onChange={handleChange}
           />
         </label>
         <br />
         <button type="submit">Submit</button>
       </form>
     )
   }
   ```

   - In this example:
     - The `formData` object stores all input values.
     - The `handleChange` function dynamically updates the specific input field using the `name` attribute.

4. **Basic Form Validation**:

   - You can easily add basic validation to forms by checking values before submitting.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function ValidationForm() {
     const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
     const [password, setPassword] = useState('')
     const [errors, setErrors] = useState({})

     const validateForm = () => {
       let formErrors = {}
       if (!email.includes('@')) {
         formErrors.email = 'Invalid email address'
       }
       if (password.length < 6) {
         formErrors.password = 'Password must be at least 6 characters long'
       }
       return formErrors
     }

     const handleSubmit = (event) => {
       event.preventDefault()
       const formErrors = validateForm()
       if (Object.keys(formErrors).length === 0) {
         console.log('Form submitted successfully')
       } else {
         setErrors(formErrors)
       }
     }

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <label>
           Email:
           <input
             type="email"
             value={email}
             onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
           />
           {errors.email && <p>{errors.email}</p>}
         </label>
         <br />
         <label>
           Password:
           <input
             type="password"
             value={password}
             onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
           />
           {errors.password && <p>{errors.password}</p>}
         </label>
         <br />
         <button type="submit">Submit</button>
       </form>
     )
   }
   ```

   - Here, the `validateForm` function checks the email and password before submission.
   - If there are validation errors, they are displayed next to the respective input fields.

5. **Form Submission Best Practices**:

   - Always prevent the default form submission using `event.preventDefault()`.
   - Ensure validation is done both on the client side (React) and server side (back-end).
   - Use meaningful error messages and give feedback to users when validation fails.

6. **Homework**:
   - Build a form that lets users enter information for a new adventure (e.g., name, description, difficulty).
   - Add **validation** to check that all fields are filled in before allowing submission.
   - Display the adventure information on the screen after submission.

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You now know how to handle **forms** and manage user input in React.
- You’ve practiced working with **controlled components** and how to handle **multiple inputs** in a form.
- You’ve also learned how to implement basic **form validation**.

Get ready for **Day 8**, where we’ll dive into **React Router** and learn how to navigate between different views in your application!

### Day 8: **React Router and Navigation**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, we will explore **React Router**, a powerful library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to create multi-page applications by mapping different URLs to different components and handling navigation between them.

#### Objective:

- Learn how to use **React Router** to navigate between different views.
- Understand how to set up **routes** and use **links** for navigation.
- Explore dynamic routing and passing parameters in URLs.

#### Tasks:

1. **Setting Up React Router**:

   - To use React Router, you need to install it:
     ```bash
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```
   - Once installed, you can start using **`BrowserRouter`**, **`Route`**, and **`Link`** to handle routing in your application.

2. **Basic Routing Example**:

   - React Router uses `BrowserRouter` to wrap your application and `Route` to map different paths to components.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import {
     BrowserRouter as Router,
     Route,
     Routes,
     Link,
   } from 'react-router-dom'

   function Home() {
     return <h2>Home Page</h2>
   }

   function About() {
     return <h2>About Page</h2>
   }

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <nav>
           <ul>
             <li>
               <Link to="/">Home</Link>
             </li>
             <li>
               <Link to="/about">About</Link>
             </li>
           </ul>
         </nav>

         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
           <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
         </Routes>
       </Router>
     )
   }

   export default App
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `BrowserRouter` (aliased as `Router`) wraps the app to enable routing.
     - `Routes` contains multiple `Route` components to define the different views.
     - The `path` prop defines the URL, and the `element` prop renders the corresponding component.
     - `Link` is used to create clickable navigation links that don't reload the page (like anchor tags but with client-side navigation).

3. **Navigating Between Pages**:

   - The **`Link`** component replaces the traditional HTML `<a>` tag and allows for smooth navigation between views.
   - **`Link to="/about"`** navigates to the "/about" page without reloading the app.

4. **Dynamic Routing**:

   - You can create dynamic routes by using **route parameters**. This allows you to pass data through the URL and display it on different pages.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'

   function AdventureDetail() {
     const { id } = useParams() // Access the dynamic URL parameter
     return <h2>Details of Adventure ID: {id}</h2>
   }

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <nav>
           <ul>
             <li>
               <Link to="/">Home</Link>
             </li>
             <li>
               <Link to="/adventure/1">Adventure 1</Link>
             </li>
             <li>
               <Link to="/adventure/2">Adventure 2</Link>
             </li>
           </ul>
         </nav>

         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<h2>Home Page</h2>} />
           <Route path="/adventure/:id" element={<AdventureDetail />} />
         </Routes>
       </Router>
     )
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - The `:id` in `/adventure/:id` is a **route parameter**, allowing dynamic content based on the URL.
     - The `useParams` hook retrieves the `id` from the URL, which can then be used within the component.

5. **Using `useNavigate` for Programmatic Navigation**:

   - Besides `Link`, React Router provides the `useNavigate` hook for **programmatic navigation** (e.g., after form submission or button clicks).

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

   function HomePage() {
     const navigate = useNavigate()

     const handleButtonClick = () => {
       navigate('/about') // Programmatically navigate to the About page
     }

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Home Page</h2>
         <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Go to About Page</button>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

   - `useNavigate` returns a function that allows you to navigate programmatically. Here, when the button is clicked, it navigates to the `/about` route.

6. **Nested Routes**:

   - You can also nest routes inside each other to create layouts or sub-pages.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureLayout() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Adventure Section</h2>
         <Outlet />
       </div>
     )
   }

   function AdventureInfo() {
     return <h3>Adventure Info</h3>
   }

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<h2>Home</h2>} />
           <Route path="/adventures" element={<AdventureLayout />}>
             <Route path="info" element={<AdventureInfo />} />
           </Route>
         </Routes>
       </Router>
     )
   }
   ```

   - The `Outlet` component is a placeholder for nested routes. The `/adventures/info` URL will render both the `AdventureLayout` component and the nested `AdventureInfo` component.

7. **Redirects and Not Found Pages**:

   - You can create redirects and "not found" (404) pages using React Router.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'

   function NotFound() {
     return <h2>Page Not Found</h2>
   }

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<h2>Home</h2>} />
           <Route path="/old-page" element={<Navigate to="/new-page" />} />
           <Route path="/new-page" element={<h2>New Page</h2>} />
           <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} /> {/* Wildcard route for 404 */}
         </Routes>
       </Router>
     )
   }
   ```

   - **`Navigate`** is used to **redirect** from one route to another (`/old-page` to `/new-page`).
   - The `*` path is a **wildcard** route, used to display a 404 page for any unmatched route.

8. **Homework**:
   - Create a small adventure app with the following features:
     - A **home page** and an **about page**.
     - A dynamic **adventure details** page that takes an adventure `id` from the URL (e.g., `/adventure/:id`).
     - Add a **not found page** for any undefined routes.
     - Implement **navigation** links to move between pages.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You've learned how to use **React Router** to add routing and navigation to your app.
- You can now map URLs to **components** using `Route` and navigate between views using `Link` and `useNavigate`.
- You’ve also explored **dynamic routes** with parameters, programmatic navigation, and handling **404 pages**.

Get ready for **Day 9**, where we’ll explore **context and global state management** with **React Context API**!

### Day 9: **React Context API and Global State Management**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, we will dive into the **React Context API** and learn how to manage **global state**. This is especially useful for sharing data across components without passing props through multiple levels.

#### Objective:

- Understand **React Context** and how to manage global state.
- Learn how to create and consume a **context**.
- Explore **context providers** and **consumers**.
- Implement global state management with the **useContext** hook.

---

#### Tasks:

1. **What is the Context API?**

   - React’s **Context API** allows you to create **global state** that can be shared across multiple components without the need to pass props manually through every level of the component tree.
   - Context is useful when many components need access to the same data, like themes, user authentication, or language settings.

2. **Creating a Context**:

   - The first step is to create a **context** using the `createContext` function.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { createContext } from 'react'

   // Create a context
   const AdventureContext = createContext(null)
   ```

   - The `AdventureContext` will hold the global state or values that will be accessible to all components inside its provider.

3. **Context Provider**:

   - To share the context value with other components, you wrap them in a **Provider**. The provider supplies the value for all components that consume the context.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { createContext, useState } from 'react'

   const AdventureContext = createContext(null)

   function AdventureProvider({ children }) {
     const [adventureName, setAdventureName] = useState('The Lost Temple')

     return (
       <AdventureContext.Provider value={{ adventureName, setAdventureName }}>
         {children}
       </AdventureContext.Provider>
     )
   }

   export { AdventureContext, AdventureProvider }
   ```

   - Here, we create a context called `AdventureContext`.
   - The `AdventureProvider` component wraps its children and provides the global state, which includes the `adventureName` and the `setAdventureName` function for updating the state.

4. **Consuming Context**:

   - Once you have a context and a provider, you can **consume** the context in any component that needs the global state.
   - React provides two ways to access context: using the `useContext` hook or `Context.Consumer`.

   Example (Using `useContext`):

   ```jsx
   import { useContext } from 'react'
   import { AdventureContext } from './AdventureProvider'

   function AdventureDisplay() {
     const { adventureName } = useContext(AdventureContext)

     return <h2>Current Adventure: {adventureName}</h2>
   }
   ```

   - **`useContext`** lets you access the context value directly. In this case, the `AdventureDisplay` component uses the `adventureName` from the global state.

   Example (Using `Context.Consumer`):

   ```jsx
   function AdventureDisplay() {
     return (
       <AdventureContext.Consumer>
         {({ adventureName }) => <h2>Current Adventure: {adventureName}</h2>}
       </AdventureContext.Consumer>
     )
   }
   ```

   - While the **`Context.Consumer`** pattern works, the `useContext` hook is much more concise and is preferred for function components.

5. **Updating Global State**:

   - The context value can be updated by consuming the **setter function** provided by the context.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   function AdventureUpdater() {
     const { setAdventureName } = useContext(AdventureContext)

     const handleChange = (event) => {
       setAdventureName(event.target.value) // Update global state
     }

     return (
       <input
         type="text"
         placeholder="Enter a new adventure"
         onChange={handleChange}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

   - Here, the `AdventureUpdater` component consumes `setAdventureName` from the context, allowing users to change the global adventure name by typing into the input field.

6. **Using Context in the App**:

   - To use the context in your app, wrap your entire app (or a specific part of the app) inside the **context provider**.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   import { AdventureProvider } from './AdventureProvider'
   import AdventureDisplay from './AdventureDisplay'
   import AdventureUpdater from './AdventureUpdater'

   function App() {
     return (
       <AdventureProvider>
         <AdventureDisplay />
         <AdventureUpdater />
       </AdventureProvider>
     )
   }

   export default App
   ```

   - In this example, the `AdventureDisplay` and `AdventureUpdater` components are wrapped in the `AdventureProvider`, meaning they have access to the shared global state.

7. **Multiple Contexts**:

   - You can also create **multiple contexts** to manage different pieces of global state, such as themes or user authentication.

   Example:

   ```jsx
   const ThemeContext = createContext(null)
   const AuthContext = createContext(null)
   ```

   - In this case, each context would have its own provider, and you can combine them using nested providers to manage different aspects of the global state.

8. **When to Use Context API?**

   - Use the Context API when:

     - You have **global data** like user authentication, themes, or settings that multiple components need to access.
     - Passing props through multiple component levels becomes cumbersome ("prop drilling").

   - Avoid using context for local state that is only needed in a few components; it’s better to manage that with individual `useState` hooks.

9. **Homework**:
   - Build an adventure management app that allows users to:
     - Add new adventure names.
     - Display the current adventure using the **React Context API**.
     - Add another feature (e.g., track the adventure difficulty) and implement it using **multiple contexts**.

---

### **Key Learnings Today:**

- You’ve learned how to use the **React Context API** to manage global state and share data across multiple components.
- You now know how to create a **context provider** and **consume** it using the `useContext` hook.
- You’ve also explored how to **update global state** and use multiple contexts to manage different data.

Prepare for **Day 10**, where we’ll wrap up the adventure by learning about **performance optimization in React** and **best practices** for building efficient apps!

### Day 10: **Performance Optimization and Best Practices in React**

#### Adventure Task:

Today, we conclude our React adventure by learning how to optimize the performance of React applications and implement best practices to ensure your apps run efficiently. React provides several tools and techniques for improving rendering performance and making your apps faster.

#### Objective:

- Learn **performance optimization techniques** in React.
- Understand how to prevent **unnecessary re-renders**.
- Explore **code-splitting** and **lazy loading** for improving load times.
- Understand best practices for writing efficient React code.

---

#### Tasks:

### 1. **Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders**

- **React re-renders** components when their state or props change. However, sometimes unnecessary re-renders can slow down your application. You can use several strategies to avoid this:

#### **Using `React.memo()` for Functional Components**:

- `React.memo` is a higher-order component that prevents a functional component from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed.

  Example:

  ```jsx
  const AdventureInfo = React.memo(function AdventureInfo({ adventureName }) {
    console.log('AdventureInfo rendered')
    return <h2>{adventureName}</h2>
  })

  function App() {
    const [adventureName, setAdventureName] = useState('The Lost City')

    return (
      <div>
        <AdventureInfo adventureName={adventureName} />
        <button onClick={() => setAdventureName('The Hidden Temple')}>
          Change Adventure
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  - `React.memo` wraps the `AdventureInfo` component, and React will skip re-rendering it unless `adventureName` changes.
  - Use this sparingly for components that re-render unnecessarily, such as components that receive stable props.

#### **Using `useCallback` to Memorize Functions**:

- Functions inside components are recreated on every render, which can trigger re-renders if they’re passed as props to child components. You can use the **`useCallback`** hook to memorize functions and prevent them from being recreated unnecessarily.

  Example:

  ```jsx
  const AdventureButton = React.memo(function AdventureButton({ onClick }) {
    console.log('AdventureButton rendered')
    return <button onClick={onClick}>Start Adventure</button>
  })

  function App() {
    const [adventure, setAdventure] = useState('The Jungle Quest')

    const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
      setAdventure('The Ocean Depths')
    }, [])

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{adventure}</h2>
        <AdventureButton onClick={handleClick} />
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  - Here, `useCallback` ensures that the `handleClick` function is only recreated if `setAdventure` changes. This prevents unnecessary re-renders of the `AdventureButton` component.

#### **Using `useMemo` for Expensive Calculations**:

- `useMemo` memorizes **expensive calculations** and prevents them from running on every render unless one of the dependencies has changed.

  Example:

  ```jsx
  function ExpensiveAdventure({ number }) {
    const calculate = (num) => {
      console.log('Calculating...')
      return num * 1000
    }

    const result = useMemo(() => calculate(number), [number])

    return <h2>Adventure Points: {result}</h2>
  }
  ```

  - The `useMemo` hook only re-runs the `calculate` function if `number` changes, saving unnecessary re-calculation on each render.

### 2. **Code-Splitting and Lazy Loading**

- **Code-splitting** allows you to split your code into smaller chunks and load them on-demand, improving the initial load time of your app.

#### **React.lazy() and Suspense**:

- `React.lazy()` is used to dynamically load components only when they are needed, which helps reduce the initial bundle size.

  Example:

  ```jsx
  import React, { Suspense } from 'react'

  const AdventureDetails = React.lazy(() => import('./AdventureDetails'))

  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to the Adventure</h1>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Adventure Details...</div>}>
          <AdventureDetails />
        </Suspense>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  - The `AdventureDetails` component is lazily loaded, meaning it is only fetched when needed.
  - `Suspense` provides a fallback UI (e.g., a loading spinner) while the component is being loaded.

#### **React Router Code-Splitting**:

- If you're using React Router, you can lazily load pages or routes:

  Example:

  ```jsx
  import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'
  import React, { Suspense } from 'react'

  const HomePage = React.lazy(() => import('./HomePage'))
  const AdventurePage = React.lazy(() => import('./AdventurePage'))

  function App() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
            <Route path="/adventure" element={<AdventurePage />} />
          </Routes>
        </Suspense>
      </Router>
    )
  }
  ```

  - Each route component is lazily loaded only when the user navigates to the respective route, improving initial load time.

### 3. **Optimizing the Rendering Process**

#### **Keyed Lists for Efficient Reconciliation**:

- When rendering lists in React, always provide a **unique key** for each item. This helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, improving performance during reconciliation.

  Example:

  ```jsx
  const AdventureList = ({ adventures }) => {
    return (
      <ul>
        {adventures.map((adventure) => (
          <li key={adventure.id}>{adventure.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )
  }
  ```

  - The `key` prop ensures efficient updates and avoids unnecessary re-renders by helping React track each list item.

#### **Avoiding Inline Functions and Object Literals**:

- Avoid creating inline functions or objects within JSX, as they are recreated on every render, causing unnecessary updates.

  Example (Inefficient):

  ```jsx
  <button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')}>Click Me</button>
  ```

  Example (Efficient):

  ```jsx
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => console.log('Clicked'), [])
  ;<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
  ```

  - Using `useCallback` ensures the function is not recreated on every render.

### 4. **React Profiler Tool**

- Use the **React DevTools Profiler** to analyze performance bottlenecks in your application. It helps identify which components are re-rendering unnecessarily and how long each render takes.

  - Install the **React DevTools extension** for your browser to gain access to the profiler.
  - Use the profiler to record user interactions and measure the impact of different optimizations on your app’s performance.

### 5. **Best Practices for Writing Efficient React Code**

- **Keep components small and focused**: Smaller components are easier to manage and optimize.
- **Use state and props wisely**: Avoid placing too much state in a single component. Move state up to a common ancestor if it needs to be shared.
- **Use `shouldComponentUpdate` or `PureComponent`** for class components: These help control when a component should re-render based on props or state changes.
- **Debounce expensive operations**: For example, if you have input fields or search functionality that trigger API requests, debounce the operation to prevent excessive re-rendering or network calls.

  Example of debouncing a search input:

  ```jsx
  const handleSearch = useCallback(
    debounce((query) => {
      fetchResults(query)
    }, 300),
    []
  )
  ```

### 6. **Homework**:

- Implement the following in your adventure app:
  - Use `React.memo` and `useCallback` to optimize unnecessary re-renders in the app.
  - Implement **lazy loading** for one or more components using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
  - Use the **React Profiler** to measure performance improvements after optimization.
