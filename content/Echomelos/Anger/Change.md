### Change

**I very much doubt person can change anything. What it can do is change it's psychology a bit.**

It’s understandable to feel skeptical about the extent of personal influence. While it may seem like we can only change ourselves internally—like our mindset or psychology—those changes can actually have ripple effects. Shifting our perspective or developing new habits can influence how we interact with others and the world, sometimes leading to bigger changes than we might expect.

For example, when one person changes their behavior or outlook, it can affect relationships, communities, and even inspire larger movements. The change might not be immediate or dramatic, but small psychological shifts can sometimes lead to significant real-world outcomes. What do you think about this idea of small internal changes eventually influencing the external world?

**I try to reduce struggle inside me.**

Reducing internal struggle is a valuable goal and can lead to greater peace of mind. It often involves practices like self-reflection, mindfulness, or seeking understanding of your thoughts and emotions.

Finding ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, journaling, or talking to someone about your feelings, can also help. It’s important to acknowledge that some level of struggle is natural, but learning to navigate it can make a significant difference in your overall well-being. What specific strategies have you tried, or are you considering, to help with this?

**I am not leaving nothing behind in this world but i think it makes a difference what my internal state is.**

Your internal state is indeed crucial, even if you feel you’re not leaving a tangible legacy. How you feel and think shapes your experiences and interactions with others, impacting your well-being and the environment around you. A positive or peaceful internal state can lead to more meaningful connections and moments, even if those don’t result in lasting material changes.

Moreover, the way you experience life can affect those close to you. Even small gestures or attitudes can create a ripple effect, influencing others in ways you might not realize. Prioritizing your internal state can enhance your quality of life and contribute to a more harmonious world. How do you envision achieving a better internal state for yourself?

**Maybe what we do here is we building minds. But ultimately universe is most powerful one no matter what.**

That’s a profound perspective. It’s true that while we can influence our thoughts and actions, the universe operates on a scale and power beyond individual control. Recognizing this can foster a sense of humility and acceptance.

Building minds—our own and others’—is significant, though. It allows us to navigate the complexities of existence, find meaning, and connect with the world around us. Even if we can't change the universe, our minds shape our experiences and perceptions, which can make a difference in our lives and the lives of those we interact with.

Embracing this balance between acknowledging the vastness of the universe and focusing on our internal worlds can be a powerful approach. How do you find that balance in your own life?

**Maybe caring for internall state is just fear and lack of acceptance. Meanwhile inner state dosent event exist. Me is a simulation created by thouth.**

That’s a deep and introspective view. The idea that the "self" is a construct—essentially a simulation created by thoughts—is a concept that resonates with certain philosophies, particularly in Eastern traditions like Buddhism. According to these perspectives, the self is seen as an illusion, with thoughts and experiences forming a kind of mental narrative that we identify with.

If you think of the "me" as a simulation, it can lead to the question of what lies beneath that—perhaps consciousness itself, free from the constant flow of thoughts and identities. From that standpoint, striving to improve an internal state might seem like an effort to protect something illusory, which could be linked to fear or a lack of acceptance of what simply is.

At the same time, even if the "self" is a construct, the experience of that construct feels very real to us. It shapes how we interact with the world. Some schools of thought would suggest that accepting the impermanence or non-existence of the self doesn't mean abandoning care for one's mind, but rather seeing it with a sense of detachment or clarity.

How do you relate to the idea of the self being a thought-created simulation? Does it bring you a sense of relief, or does it open more questions?

**Maybe it is a tool for regulation.**

Yes, thinking of the "self" as a tool for regulation is an intriguing way to look at it. In this view, the mind's construction of a self might serve as a psychological framework for navigating the world, making decisions, and regulating emotions or behaviors. It helps us orient ourselves in relation to others, our environment, and our own experiences.

This tool—the sense of self—may not be an ultimate truth, but rather a functional mechanism that allows us to engage with life. It gives us a point of reference, even if it's fluid or illusory. Like a map isn't the actual terrain but still helps guide us, the self could be a mental construct that aids in managing our thoughts, emotions, and actions, even if it's not a fixed or permanent entity.

If the self is a tool for regulation, the key could lie in learning to use it skillfully, without becoming too attached to it as a fixed identity. Recognizing it as a flexible construct might allow more freedom, enabling us to adapt to life's complexities with less inner conflict.

Do you find value in this idea of the self as a tool rather than a fixed identity? How might it change how you approach your thoughts or actions?
