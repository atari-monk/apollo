# What fast coding chalange i can make to upgrade my skill with little prep.

Here are some fast coding challenges that can help you upgrade your skills with minimal preparation:

### 1. **30-Minute Algorithm Sprint**

- **Challenge:** Solve as many algorithmic problems as you can in 30 minutes.
- **Skills:** Problem-solving, quick thinking, implementation speed.
- **Example:** Try solving basic problems like finding the maximum number in an array, reversing a string, or implementing a binary search.

### 2. **Data Structure Drill**

- **Challenge:** Implement a common data structure from scratch in under 20 minutes.
- **Skills:** Understanding of core data structures, implementation skills.
- **Example:** Implement a stack, queue, linked list, or hash map from scratch.

### 3. **One-Liner Coding**

- **Challenge:** Solve a problem using the shortest code possible (one-liners preferred).
- **Skills:** Mastery of language-specific features, concise coding.
- **Example:** Reverse a string, find the sum of an array, or sort a list using a one-liner in Python or JavaScript.

### 4. **Bug Fixing**

- **Challenge:** Find and fix bugs in a small piece of code within 15 minutes.
- **Skills:** Debugging, attention to detail, understanding existing codebases.
- **Example:** Take a small function with intentional bugs and debug it to produce the correct output.

### 5. **Optimize a Solution**

- **Challenge:** Take a brute-force solution and optimize it to run faster.
- **Skills:** Algorithm optimization, understanding time complexity.
- **Example:** Start with a simple O(n^2) solution and try to reduce it to O(n log n) or O(n) if possible.

### 6. **API Design**

- **Challenge:** Design a simple API in 30 minutes.
- **Skills:** Understanding of API design, REST principles, and practical coding.
- **Example:** Design a REST API for a basic task manager (CRUD operations for tasks).

### 7. **Code Refactoring**

- **Challenge:** Refactor a piece of messy or inefficient code in 20 minutes.
- **Skills:** Code readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- **Example:** Take a long function with repetitive code and refactor it to be more concise and efficient.

### 8. **Language Feature Exploration**

- **Challenge:** Explore a feature of a programming language you’re less familiar with.
- **Skills:** Language-specific knowledge, versatility.
- **Example:** If you’re a Python programmer, try using decorators or list comprehensions in a small program.

### 9. **Random Coding Prompt**

- **Challenge:** Use a random coding prompt generator to get a problem, and solve it in 15-30 minutes.
- **Skills:** Quick problem-solving, adaptability.
- **Example:** Websites like LeetCode, CodeWars, or HackerRank can provide random challenges for this purpose.

### 10. **Mini Project**

- **Challenge:** Build a tiny project or tool in an hour.
- **Skills:** End-to-end development, project management, creativity.
- **Example:** Create a simple calculator, to-do list app, or a command-line tool.

Each of these challenges can be done quickly and will target specific skills that are crucial for programming.
