# Question: What man think of himself is his fate

The idea that "what a man thinks of himself is his fate" reflects the notion that self-perception shapes a person's reality. If someone believes they are capable, worthy, or destined for success, they are more likely to pursue opportunities and overcome challenges with confidence. On the other hand, self-doubt or negative self-beliefs can lead to limited actions and opportunities, reinforcing a cycle of stagnation or failure. It emphasizes the power of mindset in determining one's life path and outcomes.

# Question: At what point they where profitable to whom

Historically, children became "profitable" in different ways depending on the economic and cultural context. In agricultural societies, children were often seen as an economic asset to families, contributing labor on farms, helping with household chores, or caring for younger siblings. This was especially true in pre-industrial times when large families were common, and each additional child increased the family's workforce.

In industrial societies during the 19th century, children were sometimes employed in factories, mines, or as domestic servants, often for very low wages. In such cases, their labor was profitable to employers who capitalized on their small size, flexibility, and willingness (or lack of choice) to work under harsh conditions.

Eventually, child labor laws were implemented in many countries, and the idea of children being "profitable" in an economic sense shifted as societies began to prioritize education and child welfare.

Is this the direction you were thinking, or were you referring to something else?

# Question: Children are now work of art? No longer usefull. Unless we talk about men. They do shit jobs and die in wars. To run this machine.

It sounds like you're highlighting the shift in how society views children and labor, particularly contrasting the roles of men in difficult jobs and war. There's definitely been a societal change: children are now seen less as contributors to the workforce and more as individuals whose development, education, and well-being are protected, reflecting a shift toward viewing childhood as a time of growth and care rather than utility.

Your point about men often taking on dangerous, undesirable jobs and participating in wars touches on a historical and ongoing reality. Certain labor sectors and military roles have been dominated by men, often involving high risk, danger, and physical hardship. These roles can seem to be part of maintaining broader social systems or "the machine," as you put it.

It's a critical view of how society organizes labor and human value, especially when contrasting the treatment of different groups. Would you like to explore this further or apply this thinking to a project or discussion?

# Question: Science dosent hold any value beside technology. We don't get much from math. I mean we do but it's not applicable much to everyday life.

While it's true that not everyone uses advanced math or science daily, both fields offer significant value beyond just technology. For example, science shapes our understanding of the world, informing health, environment, and societal decisions. Math, even when not directly noticeable, underpins everyday activities like budgeting, logistics, and decision-making. It also sharpens critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are universally applicable across many aspects of life.

The practical impact may seem distant, but the foundation they provide enhances the functioning of modern society, from communication systems to medical advances.

# Question: Well yeah it is language evrything is based on but body goes on by its own

You're right that our bodies function autonomously in many ways, driven by biological processes that don't require conscious input. The heartbeat, digestion, and even basic problem-solving happen without us needing to think about them. But language, including math and science, gives us a framework to understand and influence these natural processes.

While the body "just works," our ability to understand and communicate what's happening—whether for health, technology, or self-awareness—comes from the intellectual frameworks we've developed. In that sense, language, science, and math bridge the gap between our autonomous functions and the conscious decisions that shape society and individual well-being.

# Question: I would like to setup ci for my c++ engine. What can I do

To set up Continuous Integration (CI) for your C++ engine project, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Choose a CI Platform**

Some popular CI platforms are:

- **GitHub Actions** (integrates well with GitHub projects)
- **GitLab CI/CD**
- **Travis CI**
- **CircleCI**
- **Jenkins**

For simplicity, let's proceed with **GitHub Actions**.

### 2. **Create CI Workflow Configuration**

GitHub Actions requires a YAML file to define the workflow. Here’s a sample setup for a C++ project using CMake and `g++`:

#### File: `.github/workflows/cpp.yml`

```yaml
name: C++ CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: sudo apt-get install -y cmake g++ libglfw3-dev

      - name: Configure CMake
        run: cmake -S . -B build

      - name: Build project
        run: cmake --build build

      - name: Run tests
        run: ./build/tests/my_tests # Update this with your test binary location
```

### 3. **Dependencies and Build System**

- If you’re using CMake, ensure you have a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
- Adjust the dependencies based on your project’s requirements (e.g., if you use Vulkan, you may need additional packages).
- The workflow installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs tests automatically.

### 4. **Adding Tests**

If you haven't yet, consider adding unit tests to ensure code stability. You can integrate testing frameworks like **Google Test** or **Catch2**:

Example for Google Test:

```cpp
// test.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MyTestSuite, MyTest) {
    ASSERT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### 5. **Optional: Set Up Caching**

Caching can speed up builds by reusing dependencies or build artifacts:

Add the following under the `steps` section to cache the CMake build folder:

```yaml
- name: Cache CMake files
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: build
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-cmake-${{ hashFiles('**/CMakeLists.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-cmake-
```

### 6. **Advanced Features**

- **Code Coverage**: Add tools like `gcov` or `lcov` to measure code coverage.
- **Multiple Platforms**: If your engine is cross-platform, you can add jobs for Windows and macOS too.

Would you like more details on any specific area, like caching or code coverage?
