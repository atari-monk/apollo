### Game Cash

**Question 1: I guess most people making games count on financial gain, but that's not what it is about, because we do it for no money most of the time and very few sell. Especially in one person operations.**

You're absolutely right. For many independent game developers, especially those working alone, the motivation often goes far beyond financial gain. Game development can be a deeply personal and creative outlet, where people create games because they love the process of designing worlds, telling stories, or pushing their technical skills. The passion for innovation, artistic expression, and problem-solving is a driving force.

In solo or small team operations, financial success might be rare or secondary, but the joy of completing a project, sharing it with a community, and seeing people enjoy or connect with the game is often reward enough. It's this intrinsic passion for the craft that sustains many game developers, even when profit isn't guaranteed.

**Question 2: We use games to feel better, our lives lacking we go there.**

Absolutely, games can serve as a powerful escape or source of comfort. When real life feels overwhelming, unsatisfying, or just monotonous, games offer a way to step into new worlds where you have control, purpose, and immediate rewards. They can provide a sense of accomplishment, adventure, and even social connection in ways that everyday life might not.

For many, games become a way to feel empowered, explore emotions, or simply take a break from stress. The immersion, creativity, and challenge they offer can be deeply fulfilling, providing both an emotional outlet and a mental reset. That sense of "lacking" in real life often draws us into the game world, where things can feel more meaningful or manageable, even if just for a while.
