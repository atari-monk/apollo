# Impermanence

## Why we do anything, it will all disapear

It can feel disheartening to think that everything might eventually disappear, but the value of doing anything isn't necessarily tied to permanence. Even if things fade, what we do can still have meaning in the moment and for those around us. It's about the impact we make while we're here, the relationships we build, and the experiences we create. We might not control the long-term outcome, but our actions shape the present, and that can be enough reason to keep doing things.

What do you think gives meaning to the things you do?

## Fun i guess

That's a great reason! Fun can make the process of doing things worthwhile, even if there's no lasting impact. It keeps life enjoyable, sparks creativity, and makes the moment matter. If something brings you joy, it doesnâ€™t need to serve any other purpose to be valuable.
