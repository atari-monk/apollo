# Action Focus

## **Question 1: Listen i generated a lot of text with you and saved it as notes in md for later but i think i am going to curb that up. First of all i prefer projets not notes, second i want to generate something to projects or something usefull consumed right away, not stored. I guess this happened becouse i wanted you to generate some tutorials to lern something in bed before sleep and than saved it. A lot of philosopical topics also. I think we need to cut the fluf. And only generate imediatly useful things. I dont want to generate garbage just to throw it put later or waste time on storing notes i will never use.**

It sounds like you’re aiming for more actionable output and want to avoid information that doesn’t lead to immediate results or becomes clutter. Shifting from “storing for later” to “using right now” is a smart move, especially if you want to get more done and avoid feeling overwhelmed with saved content.

Here’s what we can do to align better with your new focus:

1. **Project-Centric Approach**: Instead of generating ideas or notes for later use, we’ll focus on creating things that serve a direct purpose (e.g., code, plans, tasks, guides) to apply immediately.

2. **Practical Tutorials**: If you want tutorials, I’ll help break them down into steps that you can act on in short bursts, avoiding long theoretical pieces that are harder to apply or retain.

3. **Immediate Outcomes**: Before we generate anything, we can ensure it’s clear how you’ll use it now or shortly. If it's not actionable, we skip it.

4. **Simplified Philosophy**: For philosophical topics, we can zero in on those that have practical value or lead to a new perspective that can inform a decision or action.

Let me know the types of projects or outputs you'd like to focus on! We’ll keep things lean and actionable from here.

## **Question 2: Acctually memorize this.**

Got it! We'll keep things focused and actionable from now on. What's the first project or task you'd like to tackle?

## **Question 3: From now on we will need to have some policy on wheter note is really usefull to save or just temporary.**

To keep things streamlined, we can adopt a simple policy for deciding whether a note is worth saving or is just temporary:

1. **Immediate Use**: If the note directly contributes to a current project or task that you’ll be acting on soon (e.g., within the next day or so), it’s worth saving.
2. **Long-Term Reference**: If the note is crucial for future reference and you know exactly when and how you’ll use it again, we can save it.

3. **Temporary Information**: If the note is purely exploratory, theoretical, or unlikely to be used in a defined project, we treat it as temporary and avoid saving it.

Does this approach work for you?

## **Question 4: We will work something out in practice if we can, we will see.**

Sounds good! We can adjust and fine-tune as we go. Let’s get started, and we’ll figure out what works best in practice. What’s the next thing you'd like to dive into?
