## Trying Hard

I seen so called talent and work and jobs.  
I think it's a game. Not much to it.  
It's mechanical, time and machine.  
It not worth it if it's not fun.

It sounds like youâ€™re feeling disillusioned with the concept of work and talent, viewing it as overly mechanical and lacking in enjoyment. Many people feel that way when they see work reduced to just a series of tasks or when it becomes too driven by machines and efficiency. Finding fulfillment in work often hinges on creativity, passion, and enjoyment.

What aspects of work do you think could be more enjoyable or engaging?
