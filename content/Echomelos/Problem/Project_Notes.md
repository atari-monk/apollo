# Project vs Notes

## **Question 1: What is better. Learning by doing project or listening to not so in depth notes.**

Learning by doing projects is generally considered more effective than just listening to notes, especially for subjects that require practical application, such as programming, engineering, or design. Here’s why:

1. **Hands-On Experience**: Engaging in projects allows you to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, reinforcing your understanding and helping you retain information better.

2. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Working on projects often involves encountering and solving challenges, which enhances critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

3. **Active Learning**: Project-based learning is more engaging and encourages active participation, making it easier to stay motivated and focused.

4. **Immediate Feedback**: When working on a project, you can receive immediate feedback on your work, allowing you to learn from mistakes and improve continuously.

5. **Portfolio Development**: Completing projects gives you tangible evidence of your skills and accomplishments, which can be beneficial for future job applications or academic pursuits.

While listening to notes can provide foundational knowledge, it is often more beneficial when combined with practical application through projects. Ideally, a balanced approach that incorporates both methods could maximize learning effectiveness.

## **Question 2: But notes are first step.**

Absolutely, you're right! Notes often serve as a crucial first step in the learning process. Here’s how they fit into the overall learning journey:

1. **Foundation of Knowledge**: Notes help you grasp the fundamental concepts and theories before diving into practical applications. They provide context and background that are essential for understanding more complex ideas.

2. **Structured Learning**: Listening to lectures or reviewing notes can offer a structured approach to a subject, guiding you through the important topics in a logical sequence.

3. **Reference Material**: Well-organized notes can serve as a useful reference when working on projects. They can help you recall key concepts and techniques as you apply them in practice.

4. **Cognitive Engagement**: The process of taking notes itself can enhance comprehension and retention. It encourages you to engage actively with the material, even before you start applying it.

5. **Preparation for Projects**: Good notes can prepare you for projects by highlighting important theories, tools, and methodologies that you'll need to apply.

In summary, while project-based learning is highly effective, starting with solid notes or theoretical understanding lays the groundwork for successful hands-on experiences. A combination of both—first learning through notes, followed by applying that knowledge in projects—often leads to the best outcomes.

# Switching projects

## **Question 3: Did 2 hrs of my project today. Should i switch to creating api? It will be mostly copying but quite fun, with music or sitcom in background.**

If you’ve already put in two solid hours on your project and feel like switching gears, working on the API could be a good idea. Since it sounds like it will be fun and lighter work (especially with music or a sitcom in the background), it might give you a mental break while still being productive. Balancing focused tasks with more enjoyable ones helps maintain overall productivity and motivation.

Just make sure you’re not multitasking too much if you want to ensure quality on the API work! Go for it if that mix sounds refreshing.

## **Question 4: Yeah i think doing 3 projects actively makes sense.**

Managing three projects actively can be a great way to stay engaged and motivated, as long as you keep them organized and prioritize effectively. It allows you to switch focus when you hit roadblocks in one area and can spark new ideas across projects. Just be sure to set clear goals for each project and allocate your time wisely to avoid feeling overwhelmed. How are the projects shaping up so far?
