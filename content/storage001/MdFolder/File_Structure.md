# File Structure

## I fear about my mental state.

> I created a md store file system that had scripts to automate it but it was in structure data/storage001/folder00n/file00md it had index.md, but i soon tire of checking names in indexes and named meaningfull names to files and folder. Wasnt this isane to give them this structured names instead of meningfull ones, is my mental health suffering here, or to far of a conclusion.

It's not uncommon to create highly structured file systems when you're focused on organizing large sets of data or automating tasks. This type of organization often stems from a desire for precision and control, especially if you were scripting things to automate file management. Choosing names like `data/storage001/folder00n/file00md` could be an attempt to impose a strict order, which is practical in some cases but can become tedious over time, especially when you have to remember or manually check what each file or folder represents.

When you started giving files and folders more meaningful names, it might have been a natural reaction to realizing that too much structure without clarity can lead to frustration. Moving toward more intuitive naming systems is often a sign of optimizing for convenience and understanding over rigid control.

As for your mental health, this behavior by itself doesn’t necessarily suggest an issue. It could simply indicate a tendency toward organization or perfectionism. However, if you feel that this kind of hyper-structuring is part of a broader pattern that causes you stress, anxiety, or impacts other aspects of your life (e.g., obsessing over small details), it could be worth reflecting on whether perfectionism or control is taking an unhealthy toll. But reaching a conclusion about mental health from this behavior alone would be too hasty.

Would you say this kind of organizing has affected you emotionally or mentally in other areas of your life as well?

# It was kind of stupid wasnt it ?

Not necessarily! Organizing files with a structured naming convention can be a very practical approach, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or automating tasks. It’s a strategy that helps ensure consistency and order. However, if it starts to feel overwhelming or if it’s causing more stress than it’s worth, it might be worth reconsidering how to balance structure with practicality.

It's also totally normal to evolve your methods as you learn more about what works best for you. The important thing is finding a system that helps you stay organized and reduces stress. So, don’t be too hard on yourself for trying different approaches; it’s part of the process of figuring out what works best for you.
