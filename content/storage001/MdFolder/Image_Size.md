# Image size for inventory

## I want to store pictures of my clothes on webpage, what resolution should i use ?

When storing pictures of your clothes on a webpage, the resolution depends on a few factors, such as the purpose of the images, the design of your webpage, and the balance between image quality and loading speed. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Thumbnails** (For Galleries or Overviews):

- **Resolution**: 150x150 to 300x300 pixels.
- **Purpose**: Used for quick browsing and to give users a preview of the item.
- **File Size**: Keep the file size small, usually under 50KB.

### 2. **Standard Display** (For Individual Item Pages):

- **Resolution**: 800x800 to 1200x1200 pixels.
- **Purpose**: Provides a good balance between quality and load time for a detailed view of the clothes.
- **File Size**: Aim for a file size of 100-300KB.

### 3. **High-Resolution Display** (For Zoom-In or Fullscreen View):

- **Resolution**: 1600x1600 to 2400x2400 pixels.
- **Purpose**: Allows users to zoom in and see fine details, like fabric texture.
- **File Size**: Can go up to 500KB or more, depending on the complexity of the image.

### 4. **Responsive Design Considerations**:

- Use **responsive images** (different resolutions for different screen sizes) to optimize load time on various devices.
- Consider using **WebP** or **JPEG 2000** formats, which provide better compression and quality balance compared to standard JPEG or PNG.

### 5. **Compression and Optimization**:

- Use image compression tools (e.g., TinyPNG, ImageOptim) to reduce file size without significant loss in quality.
- Ensure all images are optimized for web use to maintain fast page loading times.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your images are both high quality and efficient for your webpage.
