### **Class Name:** `Kinematics`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for managing the kinematics of entities in a game or simulation environment. It handles entity movement, friction, and stopping behavior, interacting with components like `Transform`, `RigidBody`, and `BoxCollider`.

---

### **2. Constructor**
- `__init__(entityCache: IEntityCache, logger: ILogger, _eventSystem: IEventSystem)`
    - **Description:** Initializes the `Kinematics` system, setting up the necessary dependencies.
    - **Parameters:**
        - `entityCache`: The cache used to retrieve entities and their components.
        - `logger`: An interface for logging activities within the class.
        - `_eventSystem`: The event system used for publishing events.

---

### **3. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
- `startEntity(entity: IEntity)`
    - **Description:** Called when an entity is started in the system.
    - **Behavior:** Caches the `Transform`, `RigidBody`, and `BoxCollider` components of the entity.
- `updateEntity(entity: IEntity, deltaTime: number)`
    - **Description:** Updates the entity's kinematics each frame.
    - **Behavior:** Moves the entity based on its velocity, applies friction if applicable, and checks if the entity should stop.
    - **Returns:** None.
    - **Exceptions:** None specified.

- **Key Properties:**
- `_cache`
    - **Description:** A map that stores the cached components for each entity by their ID.
    - **Behavior:** Facilitates quick access to an entity's components during updates.

---

### **4. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Provide an example of how the class and its methods should be used in practice.

    ```typescript
    const kinematics = new Kinematics(entityCache, logger, eventSystem);
    kinematics.startEntity(entity);
    kinematics.updateEntity(entity, deltaTime);
    ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Provide a second example for more advanced use or edge cases.

    ```typescript
    const kinematics = new Kinematics(entityCache, logger, eventSystem);
    kinematics.startEntity(entity);
    // Simulate update loop
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        kinematics.updateEntity(entity, 0.016); // Assuming ~60 FPS
    }
    ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - This class depends on the following modules:
    - `IEntityCache`: For caching entities.
    - `ILogger`: For logging actions and events.
    - `IEventSystem`: For event handling.
    - `Vector2`, `Transform`, `RigidBody`, `BoxCollider`: For handling entity physics.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - Interacts with `Transform` to update entity positions, `RigidBody` for physical properties, and `BoxCollider` for collision handling. It also publishes events via `IEventSystem` to signal state changes.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes that the entities have valid components (`Transform`, `RigidBody`, `BoxCollider`). It does not handle cases where these components are missing.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the `entityCache` and `eventSystem` are properly initialized and functional before using the `Kinematics` class.

---

### **7. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- The `Kinematics` class is designed for a single-threaded environment, as it relies on synchronous updates to entity states. Future improvements could include support for asynchronous processing or handling more complex physics interactions.

---

### **8. Version**
- **Version Number:** 1.0.0
- **Last Modified:** 2024-10-04
