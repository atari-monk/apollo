### **Class Name:** `CollisionBoxRendererV4`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for rendering collision boxes in a game or simulation environment. It manages the rendering of these boxes based on their styles and the current canvas scale, and it allows toggling the visibility of specific boxes via keyboard actions.

---

### **2. Constructor**
- `__init__(entityCache: IEntityCache, logger: ILogger, _renderer: IRenderer, _keyboardActionHandler?: KeyboardActionHandler)`
    - **Description:** Initializes a new instance of the `CollisionBoxRendererV4` class, setting up the necessary dependencies and initializing keyboard actions.
    - **Parameters:**
        - `entityCache`: The cache that stores game entities.
        - `logger`: The logger for recording events or errors.
        - `_renderer`: The renderer used for drawing the collision boxes.
        - `_keyboardActionHandler`: (Optional) The handler for managing keyboard actions.

---

### **3. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
- `start()`
    - **Description:** Initializes the system and calls the `switchIt` method if the keyboard action handler was successfully initialized.
    - **Behavior:** Calls the superclass start method and performs additional setup.
  
- `startEntity(entity: IEntity)`
    - **Description:** Prepares an entity for rendering by caching its transform and box colliders.
    - **Behavior:** Retrieves box collider components from the entity and stores them in the cache.
  
- `renderEntity(entity: IEntity, deltaTime: number)`
    - **Description:** Renders the cached boxes for the given entity.
    - **Behavior:** Draws filled or stroked rectangles based on the box styles and their render status.
    - **Returns:** None.
  
- **Key Properties:**
- `_canvasScale`
    - **Description:** Represents the scaling factor for rendering on the canvas.
    - **Behavior:** It adjusts how the boxes are rendered based on the canvas size.

- `_cache`
    - **Description:** A map that caches the boxes and their transforms for each entity.
  
- `_pressOnceOnStart`
    - **Description:** A flag indicating whether to switch the rendering state on start.

### **4. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Demonstrates how to instantiate and use the `CollisionBoxRendererV4`.

    ```typescript
    const entityCache = new EntityCache(); // Assume an entity cache instance is created
    const logger = new Logger(); // Assume a logger instance is created
    const renderer = new Renderer(); // Assume a renderer instance is created
    const keyboardHandler = new KeyboardActionHandler(); // Optional

    const collisionRenderer = new CollisionBoxRendererV4(entityCache, logger, renderer, keyboardHandler);
    collisionRenderer.start();
    ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  An example of adding an entity with colliders and rendering.

    ```typescript
    const entity = new Entity(); // Assume an entity is created
    entity.addComponent(new BoxCollider(/* parameters */));
    entity.addComponent(new Transform(/* parameters */));
    
    collisionRenderer.startEntity(entity);
    collisionRenderer.renderEntity(entity, deltaTime);
    ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `IRenderer`: Interface for rendering operations.
  - `IEntity`: Interface for entity interactions.
  - `System`: Base class for systems within the ECS architecture.
  - `IEntityCache`: Interface for caching entities.
  - `Transform`: Component representing an entity's transformation.
  - `BoxCollider`: Component defining collision boundaries.
  - `CanvasScale`: Component for managing the canvas scale.
  - `KeyboardActionHandler`: Handler for keyboard events.
  - `ILogger`: Interface for logging events.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - Interacts with `IEntityCache` to manage and retrieve entities.
  - Uses `IRenderer` for drawing operations based on the properties of `BoxCollider`.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - This class assumes that the provided entities have valid components and may not handle errors related to missing components gracefully.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the canvas entity is always present in the cache and has a valid `CanvasScale` component.

---

### **7. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- The implementation may need to be adapted for different rendering contexts or frameworks.
- Future improvements could include optimizing render calls and enhancing keyboard interaction feedback.
