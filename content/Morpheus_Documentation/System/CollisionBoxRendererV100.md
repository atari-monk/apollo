### **Class Name:** `CollisionBoxRendererV100`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for rendering collision boxes in a game or simulation environment. It manages the state of these boxes and their visual representation based on their associated entity's transformation and keyboard actions.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `switchIt()`
      - **Description:** Toggles the rendering state of all collision boxes managed by this class.
      - **Behavior:** This method iterates through the cached boxes and enables or disables their rendering.
      - **Returns:** None.
  
  - `start(): void`
      - **Description:** Initializes the collision box rendering system and toggles the rendering state if the keyboard action is initialized.
      - **Behavior:** Calls the parent `start` method and executes `switchIt` if `_pressOnceOnStart` is true.
      - **Returns:** None.

  - `startEntity(entity: IEntity): void`
      - **Description:** Initializes and caches the components associated with the given entity for rendering.
      - **Behavior:** Retrieves the `Transform` and `BoxCollider` components of the entity and stores them in the cache.
      - **Returns:** None.

  - `updateEntity(entity: IEntity, _deltaTime: number): void`
      - **Description:** Updates the position of each box based on the entity's transform.
      - **Behavior:** Calculates the position of each box and updates the cache accordingly.
      - **Returns:** None.

  - `renderEntity(entity: IEntity, _deltaTime: number): void`
      - **Description:** Renders each active collision box associated with the entity.
      - **Behavior:** Draws each box using the renderer, based on its position and rendering state.
      - **Returns:** None.

- **Key Properties:**
  - `_cache`
      - **Description:** A map that stores cached components for each entity, including their transformation and associated collision boxes.
      - **Behavior:** Allows for efficient access and manipulation of the components needed for rendering.

  - `_pressOnceOnStart`
      - **Description:** A flag indicating whether to toggle the rendering of boxes once on startup based on a keyboard action.
      - **Behavior:** Determines the initial state of the rendering when the system starts.

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Below is an example of how to use the `CollisionBoxRendererV100` class in a game loop.

  ```typescript
  const entityCache = new IEntityCache();
  const renderer = new IRenderer();
  const keyboardHandler = new KeyboardActionHandler();
  
  const collisionBoxRenderer = new CollisionBoxRendererV100(entityCache, renderer, keyboardHandler);
  collisionBoxRenderer.start();
  
  // Assuming we have an entity to process
  const entity = new IEntity();
  collisionBoxRenderer.startEntity(entity);
  collisionBoxRenderer.updateEntity(entity, deltaTime);
  collisionBoxRenderer.renderEntity(entity, deltaTime);
  ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Here is an example showing how to add a new entity with its components and update/render it.

  ```typescript
  const newEntity = new IEntity();
  newEntity.addComponent(new Transform());
  newEntity.addComponent(new BoxCollider());
  
  collisionBoxRenderer.startEntity(newEntity);
  collisionBoxRenderer.updateEntity(newEntity, deltaTime);
  collisionBoxRenderer.renderEntity(newEntity, deltaTime);
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `IRenderer`: Used for drawing the collision boxes.
  - `IEntityCache`: Caches the entities for processing.
  - `BoxCollider`: Represents the collision box component.
  - `Transform`: Represents the positional information of entities.
  - `KeyboardActionHandler`: Handles keyboard inputs for toggling rendering.
  - `IVector2` and `Vector2`: Represents 2D vector mathematics used for positioning.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - This class interacts with `IRenderer` for drawing and `IEntityCache` to retrieve entity information.
  - It also relies on `Transform` and `BoxCollider` components of entities to determine their rendering states and positions.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes that all entities processed have at least one `Transform` and one `BoxCollider` component.
  - It may not handle concurrent access effectively if used in a multi-threaded environment.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The class assumes that the input entities are valid and pre-validated before being passed into the system.
  - It presumes that the rendering system (`IRenderer`) is correctly implemented and available for drawing.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Future improvements could include adding support for additional collider types or optimizing rendering for large numbers of entities.
- This class is designed to work within a larger entity-component-system architecture, making it adaptable to various game engine implementations.
