### **Class Name:** `KeyboardMapping`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class manages keyboard input mapping for entities in a game or application, allowing specific actions to be triggered based on key presses.

---

### **2. Constructor**
- `__init__(entityCache, logger, _inputManager, _eventSystem)`
    - **Description:** Initializes the `KeyboardMapping` class, setting up dependencies and initializing key actions.
    - **Parameters:**
        - `entityCache`: An instance of `IEntityCache` used to manage entities.
        - `logger`: An instance of `ILogger` for logging purposes.
        - `_inputManager`: An instance of `IInputManager` to handle input events.
        - `_eventSystem`: An instance of `IEventSystem` for publishing keyboard events.

---

### **3. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
- `initKeyAction()`
    - **Description:** Initializes the mapping of keys to their respective action handlers.
    - **Returns:** A mapping of key strings to functions that handle the associated key events.
  
- `startEntity(entity: IEntity)`
    - **Description:** Subscribes the given entity to keyboard input events upon starting.
    - **Behavior:** Calls `subscribe` method to register the entity for input.
  
- `subscribe(entity: IEntity)`
    - **Description:** Subscribes the specified entity to keyboard down events.
    - **Behavior:** Sets up a callback to handle key presses and publish events through the event system.
    - **Parameters:**
        - `entity`: The entity to subscribe for input events.

- `unsubscribe()`
    - **Description:** Unsubscribes from keyboard input events, removing the callback for the current entity.

- **Key Properties:**
- `_keyActions`
    - **Description:** A mapping of key strings to their corresponding action functions.
    - **Behavior:** Contains functions that publish keyboard events to the event system when keys are pressed.

---

### **4. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Demonstrates how to instantiate the `KeyboardMapping` class and subscribe an entity to keyboard input.

    ```javascript
    const keyboardMapping = new KeyboardMapping(entityCache, logger, inputManager, eventSystem);
    keyboardMapping.startEntity(entity);
    ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Shows how to unsubscribe the entity from keyboard input events.

    ```javascript
    keyboardMapping.unsubscribe();
    ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `IEventSystem`: Required for publishing keyboard events.
  - `IInputManager`: Required for handling input events.
  - `IEntityCache`: Required for managing entities.
  - `ILogger`: Required for logging events and errors.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - This class interacts with `IInputManager` to listen for keyboard events and with `IEventSystem` to publish those events to subscribers.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - This class assumes the key mappings are fixed and do not allow dynamic reconfiguration during runtime.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the input manager correctly handles input events and provides valid key inputs.

---

### **7. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- This class can be extended to include more keys or modify existing key mappings based on game or application requirements.

---

### **8. Version**
- **Version Number:** 1.0.0
- **Last Modified:** 2024-10-02
