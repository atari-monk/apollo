### **Class Name:** `DrawVelocity`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for rendering the velocity vectors of entities in a 2D space, utilizing their transformation and rigid body properties.

---

### **2. Constructor**
- `__init__(entityCache: IEntityCache, logger: ILogger, _renderer: IRenderer)`
    - **Description:** Initializes the `DrawVelocity` system with dependencies for entity caching, logging, and rendering.
    - **Parameters:**
        - `entityCache`: The cache responsible for managing entity data.
        - `logger`: The logger used for outputting system messages.
        - `_renderer`: The renderer that handles drawing operations.

---

### **3. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
- `getCanvasScale()`
    - **Description:** Retrieves the canvas scale component from the canvas entity.
    - **Behavior:** Assumes that the canvas entity exists and has a `CanvasScale` component.
    - **Returns:** Returns the canvas scale instance.
  
- `startEntity(entity: IEntity): void`
    - **Description:** Initializes and caches the transform and rigid body components for a newly added entity.
    - **Behavior:** Stores the components in the internal cache for use during rendering.
  
- `renderEntity(entity: IEntity, _deltaTime: number): void`
    - **Description:** Renders the velocity vector for the specified entity.
    - **Behavior:** Retrieves cached components and draws the velocity vector on the canvas if the entity is present in the cache.
    - **Returns:** None.

- **Key Properties:**
- `_cache`
    - **Description:** A Map that stores cached transform and rigid body components for each entity.
    - **Behavior:** Used to optimize rendering by avoiding repeated component retrieval.
  
- `canvasScale`
    - **Description:** Represents the scaling factors of the canvas used for rendering.
    - **Behavior:** Provides the scale factor for drawing velocity vectors.

### **4. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Provide an example of how the class and its methods should be used in practice.

    ```typescript
    const drawVelocitySystem = new DrawVelocity(entityCache, logger, renderer);
    drawVelocitySystem.startEntity(entity);
    drawVelocitySystem.renderEntity(entity, deltaTime);
    ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Provide a second example for more advanced use or edge cases.

    ```typescript
    const canvasScale = drawVelocitySystem.getCanvasScale();
    console.log(canvasScale.scaleFactor);
    ```

---

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `IRenderer`: For rendering velocity vectors.
  - `IEntityCache`: For caching entity data.
  - `CanvasScale`: For handling scaling of the canvas.
  - `Transform`: For accessing entity position and rotation.
  - `RigidBody`: For retrieving velocity data.
  - `ILogger`: For logging system messages.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - Interacts with `IEntityCache` to retrieve entity components and `IRenderer` to draw on the canvas.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes that the canvas entity is always present and contains the `CanvasScale` component.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that all entities processed will have both `Transform` and `RigidBody` components.

---

### **7. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Consider adding error handling for cases where entities do not have the expected components.
- Future improvements could include support for different drawing styles or performance optimizations for large numbers of entities.
