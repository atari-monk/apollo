### **Class Name:** `SequentialAnimation`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class implements the `IAnimationStrategy` interface, responsible for managing and updating animations in a sequential manner. It determines the current frame of the animation based on elapsed time and frame durations.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `update(deltaTime: number, state: AnimationState): void`
      - **Description:** Updates the animation state by calculating the elapsed time and determining the current frame to display.
      - **Behavior:** It increments the current frame index if the elapsed time since the last frame exceeds the duration for the current animation frame. If the end of the animation sequence is reached, it loops back to the first frame.
      - **Returns:** This method does not return a value.
      - **Exceptions:** No specific exceptions are thrown; however, it assumes that the `state` object is correctly initialized.

- **Key Properties:**
  - (No properties defined in the class itself. It operates directly on the `state` parameter.)

---

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Demonstrating how to update an animation using the `SequentialAnimation` class.

  ```javascript
  const animationState = new AnimationState();
  const sequentialAnimation = new SequentialAnimation();

  // Simulate a frame update with a delta time of 0.016 (for 60 FPS)
  sequentialAnimation.update(0.016, animationState);
  ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Example of initializing and updating an animation state.

  ```javascript
  const animationState = new AnimationState();
  animationState.animations = [
    [/* frames for animation 1 */],
    [/* frames for animation 2 */]
  ];
  animationState.frameDurations = [0.5, 0.5]; // 0.5 seconds per frame for each animation
  animationState.currentAnimationIndex = 0;

  const sequentialAnimation = new SequentialAnimation();
  
  // Update the animation state in a loop
  setInterval(() => {
    sequentialAnimation.update(0.016, animationState);
    console.log(animationState.currentFrameIndex);
  }, 16); // Roughly 60 FPS
  ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `IAnimationStrategy`: This class depends on the interface that it implements.
  - `AnimationState`: It requires an instance of `AnimationState` to manage animation state and frame details.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - The `SequentialAnimation` class interacts with `AnimationState` by updating its properties based on the animation logic defined in the `update` method.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - This class does not handle animations with different frame rates within the same animation index.
  - It assumes that the animations array and frame durations are properly initialized and have valid entries.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that `state.currentAnimationIndex` is a valid index within the `animations` array.
  - The `frameDurations` array must match the number of animations available in the `animations` array.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Consider implementing error handling to ensure that invalid indices or states do not lead to unexpected behavior.
- Future improvements could include adding support for easing functions or transitions between animations.
