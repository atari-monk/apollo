### **Class Name:** `SpriteAnimator`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This class is responsible for animating sprites within a game or application. It manages loading animation frames from a sprite sheet, updating the current animation state based on elapsed time, and rendering the current frame to a canvas.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `constructor(animationConfigs, renderer, cyclicAnimation, sequentialAnimation)`
      - **Description:** Initializes the `SpriteAnimator` instance with animation configurations, a renderer, and strategies for cyclic and sequential animations.
      - **Behavior:** Loads the initial image and creates animation frames based on the provided configuration.
  - `update(deltaTime)`
      - **Description:** Updates the animation state based on the time elapsed since the last update.
      - **Behavior:** Utilizes the current animation strategy to update the animation state.
      - **Returns:** `void`
  - `switchAnimation(animationIndex)`
      - **Description:** Changes the current animation to the specified index.
      - **Behavior:** Updates the sprite's image source and resets the animation state to the first frame of the new animation.
      - **Returns:** `void`
  - `draw(ctx, transform, isFlipped, canvasScale)`
      - **Description:** Renders the current frame of the animation onto the provided canvas context.
      - **Behavior:** Draws the sprite either normally or flipped based on the `isFlipped` parameter.
      - **Returns:** `void`

- **Key Properties:**
  - `image`
      - **Description:** Holds the loaded image for the sprite animations.
  - `animations`
      - **Description:** A 2D array containing the frames for each animation based on the configuration provided.
  - `animationStrategy`
      - **Description:** The current animation strategy being used (either cyclic or sequential).
  - `animationState`
      - **Description:** Maintains the current state of the animation, including the current animation index and frame index.

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  Here's a basic usage example of how to create and use the `SpriteAnimator`.

    ```javascript
    const animator = new SpriteAnimator(animationConfigs, renderer, cyclicStrategy, sequentialStrategy);
    animator.update(deltaTime);
    animator.draw(ctx, transform, false, canvasScale);
    ```

- **Example 2 (Optional):**
  Switching animations during runtime and rendering the new state.

    ```javascript
    animator.switchAnimation(1); // Switch to the second animation
    animator.update(deltaTime);
    animator.draw(ctx, transform, true, canvasScale); // Draw flipped
    ```

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - Imports `Vector2`, `IVector2`, `ITransform`, `AnimationType`, `IAnimationConfig`, `IAnimationFrame`, `ISpriteAnimator`, `IRenderer`, `AnimationState`, and `IAnimationStrategy`.
  
- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - Interacts with `IRenderer` for drawing frames and relies on `IAnimationStrategy` for managing different animation behaviors (cyclic or sequential).

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - The class assumes that the animation configurations are correctly set up and that the sprite sheet images are loaded prior to rendering.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It assumes that the animation frames defined in `IAnimationConfig` are within valid bounds and that the `renderer` can handle both normal and flipped drawing operations.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- This class can be extended to support additional animation types or more complex rendering logic.
- Future improvements could include adding support for event callbacks when animations complete or implementing a more sophisticated state management system.
