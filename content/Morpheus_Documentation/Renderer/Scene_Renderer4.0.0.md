### **Scene Name:** `renderer400`

---

### **1. Scene Overview**
- **Description:**
  This scene tests the RendererV4 system, showcasing its ability to scale sprites according to both the canvas scale and the sprite scale. It effectively centers the sprite using the transform.position, employing canvas drawImage and canvas transformations for rendering.

- **Version:** `1.0.0`
  - This is the initial version of the scene.

---

### **2. Key Features**
- **Primary Elements:**
  - **Element 1: Sprites**
    - **Position:** Defined by the center of the sprite.
    - **Description:** Rendered using canvas transformations to ensure proper scaling and positioning within the scene.
  
- **Core System Components:**
  - `RendererV4 1.0.0`
    - **Description:** Handles sprite rendering and scaling based on both canvas and sprite scales, ensuring the transform.position is at the center of the sprite.
  - `canvasScaler`
    - **Description:** Manages the scaling of the canvas to adjust for different screen sizes and resolutions.

---

### **3. Behavior and Logic**
- **Special Behavior:**
  - **Sprite Scaling:** The scene dynamically scales sprites based on both the canvas scale and individual sprite scale settings.
  - **Centering Mechanism:** The `transform.position` is set to the center of the sprite, achieved through effective use of canvas drawImage and transformations.

- **Behavioral Notes:**
  - The design decision to use canvas transformations was made to enhance rendering performance and provide a flexible approach to sprite manipulation.

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - Depends on the RendererV4 system and canvasScaler.

- **Interactions with Other Systems:**
  - This scene interacts with the main game loop for rendering updates and may influence UI components that require synchronized scaling.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - Potential performance issues when rendering a high number of sprites due to canvas transformations.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that sprite scaling remains consistent across various devices and resolutions, ensuring a uniform appearance.

---

### **7. Historical Notes (Optional)**
- **Reasoning for Deprecated/Legacy Features:**
  - No deprecated features noted; this is the latest iteration focused on enhancing the sprite rendering pipeline.
