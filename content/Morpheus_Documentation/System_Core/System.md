### **Class Name:** `System`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**
  This abstract class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of entities in a system, including their registration, initialization, updates, and rendering. It serves as a base class for other specific systems that handle entity management in a game or simulation engine.

---

### **2. Key Methods and Properties**
- **Primary Methods:**
  - `constructor(entityCache: IResourceCache<IEntity>, logger: ILogger)`
    - **Description:** Initializes a `System` object with an entity cache and logger.
    - **Behavior:** Stores the cache and logger as protected members. No side effects.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `registerEntityById(entity: IEntity): void`
    - **Description:** Registers a single entity by fetching it from the cache using its ID.
    - **Behavior:** Adds the entity to the `entities` array.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** May throw an error if the entity is not found in the cache.

  - `registerEntitiesById(entities: IEntity[]): void`
    - **Description:** Registers multiple entities by fetching each from the cache using their IDs.
    - **Behavior:** Replaces the current `entities` array with the new list of registered entities.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** May throw an error if any entity is not found in the cache.

  - `start(): void`
    - **Description:** Initializes the system and starts all registered entities.
    - **Behavior:** Calls `initializeOnStart` and `startEntity` for each entity.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `update(deltaTime: number): void`
    - **Description:** Updates all registered entities based on the given `deltaTime`.
    - **Behavior:** Calls `updateEntity` for each entity.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `render(deltaTime: number): void`
    - **Description:** Renders all registered entities based on the given `deltaTime`.
    - **Behavior:** Calls `renderEntity` for each entity.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `initializeOnStart(): void`
    - **Description:** Initializes the system when starting. Logs a debug message by default.
    - **Behavior:** Can be overridden by subclasses for custom start logic.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `startEntity(entity: IEntity): void`
    - **Description:** Logs the starting of a single entity. Can be customized.
    - **Behavior:** Can be overridden by subclasses for custom start logic.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `updateEntity(entity: IEntity, deltaTime: number): void`
    - **Description:** Updates an individual entity. This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses.
    - **Behavior:** No default behavior.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

  - `renderEntity(entity: IEntity, deltaTime: number): void`
    - **Description:** Renders an individual entity. This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses.
    - **Behavior:** No default behavior.
    - **Returns:** N/A
    - **Exceptions:** N/A

- **Key Properties:**
  - `entities: IEntity[]`
    - **Description:** A list of all entities registered in the system.
    - **Behavior:** Managed internally; populated via `registerEntityById` and `registerEntitiesById`.

  - `entityCache: IResourceCache<IEntity>`
    - **Description:** A cache for storing and retrieving entities.
    - **Behavior:** Read-only, used to fetch entities by their IDs.

  - `logger: ILogger`
    - **Description:** A logger used for logging debug messages and other events.
    - **Behavior:** Used in various methods for logging actions like starting or updating entities.

### **3. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
  ```typescript
  class MyCustomSystem extends System {
    protected updateEntity(entity: IEntity, deltaTime: number) {
      // Custom logic for updating an entity
      console.log(`Updating entity ${entity.id} with deltaTime ${deltaTime}`);
    }

    protected renderEntity(entity: IEntity, deltaTime: number) {
      // Custom logic for rendering an entity
      console.log(`Rendering entity ${entity.id} with deltaTime ${deltaTime}`);
    }
  }

  const system = new MyCustomSystem(entityCache, logger);
  system.registerEntityById(someEntity);
  system.start();
  system.update(16);
  system.render(16);
  ```

---

### **4. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `IResourceCache`: Used for entity caching and retrieval.
  - `ILogger`: Used for logging debug messages and system events.

- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - Interacts with `IEntity` objects representing the individual entities managed by the system.
  - The `entityCache` is a source of entities that the system can register and manage.

---

### **5. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - This is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. It requires concrete implementations of methods like `updateEntity` and `renderEntity`.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that all entities passed to the system have valid IDs and can be retrieved from the `entityCache`.
  - Assumes that the `logger` implements the `ILogger` interface and is properly configured.

---

### **6. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- This class is part of an entity-component-system (ECS) architecture and is designed to be extended for specific system behaviors like physics, rendering, or AI management.

### **7. Point about Linter**
In your code, you have two ESLint rules disabled:

1. **`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-function`**: This rule prevents the use of empty functions, as they usually indicate incomplete or unused code. In your case, you have empty implementations for methods like `updateEntity` and `renderEntity`. This is common in abstract classes where you define a structure but let subclasses implement the actual behavior. Disabling this rule makes sense because you're intentionally leaving these methods empty to be implemented by child classes.

2. **`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`**: This rule prevents variables or parameters that are declared but not used, which might be a sign of dead or unnecessary code. In your class, you declare parameters like `deltaTime` in `updateEntity` and `renderEntity`, but you don't use them in the base class. These parameters will likely be used in subclasses, so it's safe to disable this rule in this case too.

Since these cases are valid in the context of abstract classes and intended structure, disabling the rules is appropriate here. The linter doesn't consider this specific context and applies general rules, so manually disabling them is the most straightforward solution.
