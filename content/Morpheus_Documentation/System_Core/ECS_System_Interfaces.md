### **Interface Group Documentation Template**

### **Interface Group Name:** ECS System Interfaces

---

### **1. Group Purpose**

- **Description:**
  This group of interfaces is designed to define the core behaviors of systems within an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. These interfaces handle the registration, updating, rendering, and management of entities within ECS-based applications, commonly used in game development and simulations.

---

### **2. Common Responsibilities Across Interfaces**

- **Shared Purpose:**
  - All interfaces in this group contribute to managing entities' lifecycle within the ECS. They share responsibilities such as starting systems, updating the state of entities, rendering them, and registering entities by their ID.
  - Each interface defines a specific responsibility (starting, updating, rendering, or registering) that ensures cohesive and efficient entity management.

---

### **3. Key Interfaces and Their Methods**

- **Interface Name:** `IRegisterEntityById`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `registerEntityById(entity: IEntity): void`
      - **Description:** Registers a given entity by its unique ID.
      - **Behavior:** Ensures the entity is stored and can be referenced by its ID for future operations.
      - **Returns:** `void`
      - **Exceptions:** May throw an error if the entity fails to register due to invalid data or duplicate ID conflicts.

- **Interface Name:** `IStartable`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `start(): void`
      - **Description:** Initiates the system, setting it into a ready state to begin processing entities.
      - **Behavior:** Prepares the system for updates and other operations, possibly allocating necessary resources.
      - **Returns:** `void`

- **Interface Name:** `IUpdateable`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `update(deltaTime: number): void`
      - **Description:** Updates the system or entities based on the elapsed time.
      - **Behavior:** Processes any changes or behaviors that need to occur over time, such as movement or state updates.
      - **Returns:** `void`

- **Interface Name:** `IRenderable`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `render(deltaTime: number): void`
      - **Description:** Renders the system or entities visually based on the elapsed time.
      - **Behavior:** Draws or displays entities as needed during the render cycle.
      - **Returns:** `void`

- **Interface Name:** `ISystem`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `registerEntitiesById(entities: IEntity[]): void`
      - **Description:** Registers a list of entities by their IDs.
      - **Behavior:** Adds multiple entities into the system, ensuring each is tracked by its unique ID.
      - **Returns:** `void`
    - Inherits the methods from `IStartable`, `IUpdateable`, `IRenderable`, and `IRegisterEntityById`, combining their functionalities.

### **4. Usage Examples**

- **Example 1 (Basic Implementation):**
  Provide an example of how an interface from the group might be implemented in practice.

  ```typescript
  class MyEntitySystem implements ISystem {
    start(): void {
      // Start system logic here
    }

    update(deltaTime: number): void {
      // Update entities here
    }

    render(deltaTime: number): void {
      // Render entities here
    }

    registerEntityById(entity: IEntity): void {
      // Register entity by ID logic
    }

    registerEntitiesById(entities: IEntity[]): void {
      // Register multiple entities logic
    }
  }
  ```

- **Example 2 (Advanced Usage or Multiple Interfaces):**
  Show an example of using multiple interfaces together or implementing advanced features.

  ```typescript
  class AdvancedEntitySystem implements ISystem {
    start(): void {
      // Start the advanced system
    }

    update(deltaTime: number): void {
      // Complex entity update logic here
    }

    render(deltaTime: number): void {
      // Complex render logic for multiple entities
    }

    registerEntityById(entity: IEntity): void {
      // Register a single entity with additional features
    }

    registerEntitiesById(entities: IEntity[]): void {
      // Register multiple entities with advanced features
    }
  }
  ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**

- **Dependencies:**
  - These interfaces depend on the `IEntity` interface for entity management.
  - Other modules include `Logger` for logging system activity, and any game engine utilities for rendering and updating.

- **Interactions with Other Interfaces or Classes:**
  - Systems that implement these interfaces are typically integrated with a central ECS manager that coordinates between multiple systems.
  - The `ISystem` interface extends `IStartable`, `IUpdateable`, `IRenderable`, and `IRegisterEntityById`, meaning it interacts closely with entity classes and other systems handling similar functions.

---

### **6. Variations and Extensibility**

- **Known Variations:**
  - `ISystem` defines the combination of behaviors, whereas individual interfaces like `IStartable`, `IUpdateable`, and `IRenderable` can be implemented separately for more specialized systems.
  - Synchronous and asynchronous variations may exist for systems with different performance needs.

- **Extensibility:**
  - New systems can be added to this group by conforming to the required interfaces, such as implementing `ISystem` and adhering to entity registration, update, and render patterns.
  - Additional methods can be added to extend the functionality of existing systems, such as introducing asynchronous entity management.

---

### **7. Limitations and Assumptions**

- **Known Limitations:**
  - These interfaces assume that the system will always work with entities that implement the `IEntity` interface. If entities do not conform, it may lead to errors.
  - No transaction management or rollback mechanisms are defined, so changes are applied immediately.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It is assumed that entities passed into the system are properly initialized and validated before registration.
  - The system is expected to be started before any updates or rendering occurs.

---

### **8. Additional Notes (Optional)**

- Future versions of this interface group may include support for asynchronous update and render operations to improve performance in real-time simulations.
- Consider implementing a dependency injection framework to simplify the testing and extension of systems using these interfaces.
