# **Class Documentation**

### **Class Name:** `BallFieldCollisionHandlerV2`

---

### **1. Class Purpose**
- **Description:**  
  This class handles the collision detection between a ball and the boundaries of a field, managing the reaction of the ball when it collides with field edges and adjusting its velocity accordingly. It ensures a cooldown between consecutive collisions to prevent rapid switching of states.

---

### **2. Constructor**
- `constructor()`
    - **Description:**  
      Initializes the `BallFieldCollisionHandlerV2` instance with default values for `switchingEnabled` and `cooldownDuration`.  
      No parameters are required in the constructor.

---

### **3. Key Methods and Properties**

- **Primary Methods:**
  - `onCollisionHandler(collision: ICollision)`
    - **Description:**  
      Handles the collision event between objects in the field. Specifically, it alters the ball's velocity based on the position of the collision, and disables further collisions for a short cooldown duration to prevent rapid state changes.
    - **Behavior:**  
      - The method checks the `id` of the collided object (ball and field edge). If the collision occurs on any boundary of the field (`top`, `bottom`, or corners), the ball's velocity is reversed depending on the collision's normal vector.
      - The method temporarily disables further collision handling by setting `switchingEnabled` to `false`, then re-enables it after the cooldown.
    - **Returns:**  
      This method doesn't return a value (`void`).
    - **Exceptions:**  
      No exceptions are explicitly thrown by this method.

  - `offCollisionHandler(collision: ICollision)`
    - **Description:**  
      A placeholder method for disabling the collision handler, which currently has no implementation.
    - **Behavior:**  
      This method does nothing in its current form.
    - **Returns:**  
      This method doesn't return a value (`void`).

- **Key Properties:**
  - `switchingEnabled`
    - **Description:**  
      A boolean flag that controls whether collision handling is active. It is temporarily disabled after a collision occurs and re-enabled after a cooldown period.
    - **Behavior:**  
      This flag is toggled based on the cooldown mechanism.
  - `cooldownDuration`
    - **Description:**  
      An integer representing the time in milliseconds that the collision handler waits before re-enabling itself after handling a collision.
    - **Behavior:**  
      The duration is set to `200` milliseconds by default.

### **4. Usage Examples**
- **Example 1:**
    ```typescript
    const collisionHandler = new BallFieldCollisionHandlerV2();
    collisionHandler.onCollisionHandler(collisionEvent);
    ```

- **Example 2:**
    ```typescript
    const collisionHandler = new BallFieldCollisionHandlerV2();
    collisionHandler.offCollisionHandler(collisionEvent);
    ```

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**
- **Dependencies:**
  - This class depends on two interfaces: `ICollision` (from `collision_detector`) and `ICollisionHandler`.
  
- **Interactions with Other Classes:**
  - The class interacts with objects that implement the `ICollision` interface, manipulating their properties, such as `transform.position` and `rigidBody.velocity`, based on collision events.

---

### **6. Limitations and Assumptions**
- **Known Limitations:**
  - This handler is limited to handling specific boundary collisions (`top`, `bottom`, and corners). It doesnâ€™t handle collisions on other field areas.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The class assumes that objects involved in the collision provide valid `transform` and `rigidBody` data and that their IDs represent specific field boundaries (e.g., `top_left`, `bottom_right`).

---

### **7. Additional Notes (Optional)**
- Potential future improvement: Add functionality to handle off-collision cases.

### **8. Version**
- **Version Number:** 1.0.0
- **Last Modified:** 2024-10-04
