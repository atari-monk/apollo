## Do you think i should document each class in my engine ?

Documenting each class in your engine is generally a good idea, especially if the engine is complex or intended for use by others (or even your future self). Here are a few reasons why it's beneficial:

1. **Clarity and Maintainability**: Well-documented classes make it easier to understand the structure and purpose of the code. This is crucial when revisiting the project after some time or when others need to work on the code. Clear documentation helps in quickly grasping what each class is supposed to do.

2. **Ease of Debugging and Refactoring**: When the purpose and functionality of each class are clearly outlined, it becomes easier to identify issues or make improvements without inadvertently breaking functionality. Documentation can guide you through the logic and dependencies within your engine.

3. **Collaboration**: If you're working with a team, or plan to open-source the engine, thorough documentation is essential. It allows others to contribute more effectively and understand the codebase without requiring extensive explanations.

4. **Learning and Knowledge Sharing**: Documenting your classes forces you to think deeply about how they work and how they fit into the overall architecture. This can lead to better design decisions and a deeper understanding of your own code.

5. **Future Proofing**: If you need to extend or adapt your engine later on, having a well-documented codebase will save you time and effort, reducing the likelihood of errors or redundant work.

### What to Document

-   **Class Purpose**: Briefly describe what the class is responsible for.
-   **Key Methods and Properties**: Explain the most important methods and properties, especially any that have non-obvious behaviors or side effects.
-   **Usage Examples**: If applicable, provide examples of how the class is intended to be used.
-   **Dependencies and Interactions**: Note any important relationships with other classes or modules.
-   **Limitations and Assumptions**: Mention any known limitations or assumptions within the class.

### When to Document

-   **During Development**: It's often helpful to write at least some documentation as you develop the class, while the logic is fresh in your mind.
-   **Before Major Changes**: Documenting the current state before making major changes can help you understand what needs to be altered and why.
-   **After Finalizing**: Once a class is considered "complete," ensure the documentation is thorough and reflects the final design.

In summary, documenting each class in your engine will pay off in the long run, enhancing both the usability and longevity of your project.
