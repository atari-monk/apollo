# Script `create_folders.py` prompts.

1. Ok create me a cript that will make root and storageN with 100 folders but only if it dosent exist, take storage nr as param.

2. Dont create subfolders 0..100 if they present.

3. Do 100 not 101 folders so i gues 99.

4. I see code is not dry.

5. Lets leave data hard coded but lets take storage number as script param.

6. This is fine, now add a method that will generate index.md in each folder001 - 99 with this content: #.

7. Ok but do not place index.md in data and storage folders, only in folder000, also start numbering folders form 001 to 099.
